of the Republic of Belarus

pursuantto paragraphs13 and 14 of Decision 1/CP.20
adoptedby the Conferenceof the Partiesto UNFCCC

Executive Summary

The Republic of Belarus supportsthe collective efforts of the Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(hereinafter referred to
as UNFCCC) to achieve the major milestone of this century - keeping the average
global
temperature rise below two degrees Celsius as compared to the pre-
industrial period. In order to contribute to the prevention of dangerous climate
change, the Republic of Belarus submits its intended nationally determined
contribution to these efforts and undertakes by 2030 to reduce greenhousegas
emissions by at least 28 per cent of the 1990 level, excluding emissions and
removals in the land use, land-use change and forestry sector and without any
additional conditions (the commitments do not imply the use of the international
carbon market mechanisms or mobilizing foreign nnancial resources for the
implementation of best available technologies).

additional policies and measures to reduce carbon intensity. According to the
projections, after 2030 an upward trend in greenhousegas emissionswill continue
to be observedwith a peak in 2035.

Target Type

Absolute reduction of greenhousegas emissions comparedto the emissions

in the baseyear.

Base Year

Year 1990 is chosen as the base year

for determining quantifiable
greenhousegas emission reduction target. The sameyear was also adoptedby the
Republic of Belarus as the reference point when undertaking greenhouse gas
emission commitments as part of previous international agreements on climate
change.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

in the Base Year

To obtain data on greenhousegas emissions in the base year, the National
GreenhouseGas Inventory of 2012 was used. The data of this inventory were also
included in the Sixth National Communication sentto the UNFCCC Secretariatin
February 2015, and underwent expert review by the UNFCCC Secretariatin April
2015.

According to thesedata, greenhousegas emissionsin 1990 were 139,151.23
thousand tons in C02 eq., excluding the land use, land-use change and forestry
sector(hereinafter referred to asLULUCF).

Period Covered

Taking into account the National Sustainable Development Strategy until

2030, the year 2030 is taken asthe target year for thesecommitments.

Therefore,

the validity period of all commitments and targets of

this

document coversthe period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030.

Scopeof Commitments

In view of

the methodology adopted in the country and reporting
the current
requirements regarding UNFCCC greenhouse gas inventories,
commitments cover information on greenhouse gas emissions in the following
sectors:

— power industry;
— industrial processes,
— use of solvents,
— agriculture,
— waste.

Approaches regarding the inclusion of

the LULUCF sector into these
commitments, which in the Republic of Belarus representsnet removals of carbon
from the atmosphere,will be determined after clarincation of the methodological
questionsrelating to the estimation of emissionsand removals of greenhousegases
in this sector. No later than 2020, the Republic of Belarus will
return to the
question of including the potential of this sectorin its commitments.
Thesecommitments include the following greenhousegases:
— carbon dioxide (C02);
— methane(CH4),
— nitrous oxide (N20),
— hydronuorocarbons(HFCs);
— pernuorocarbons(PFCs);
— sulphur hexanuoride(SF6).

The Process of Planning and Fulfilment

0f Commitments

Long-term targets, on which the climate policy until 2020 is based, are
specined in the Directive of the President of the Republic of Belarus No.3 of
14.06.2007 "Economy and thrift are the main factors of the economic security of
the state", the Concept of Energy Security of the Republic of Belarus (adopted by
the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No.433 of 17.09.2007),the
Strategy for the Development of Energy Potential of
the Republic of Belarus
(adoptedby the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus
No.1180 of 09.08.2010), national and sector-specific modernization and
development programmes for the period until 2020, which list is presentedin the
Sixth National Communication (2015),
including the National Programme of
Measuresto Mitigate Climate Changefor 2013-2020 (adoptedby the Resolution of
the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No.510 of 21.06.2013). Thus,
currently and until the end of 2020 there are various binding legislative provisions
and other regulations in effect in the Republic of Belarus, specifying policies and
measures with targets for the reduction of energy and carbon intensity of
the
national economy.

For the period of 2021-2030, the National SustainableDevelopment Strategy
until 2030 approved by the Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the Republic
of Belarus is a benchmark, which places due emphasis on the development
principles founded on a low-carbon economy.

In 2016-2019, the legislative basis for the new national climate policy will
be elaboratedalong with the programmesfor the development of major economic
activities for
including measures regulating and
stimulating the reduction of greenhousegasemissions.

breakdown by sector, Gg C02 eq.

During the period under review, maximum greenhousegas emissions were
observedin 1990: 139,151.23thousandtons of COz-eq.(excl. LULUCF).
In 2012,
the emissions amounted to 89,283.33 thousand tons in COz-eq. (excl. LULUCF)
and decreasedby 35.8 per cent ascomparedto 1990.

Such reduction in greenhousegas emissions was, first, due to the dramatic
emission reduction during the 1990-1995period as a consequenceof the economic
recession in the country following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the
subsequentdecreasein production and fuel consumption.

From 1995, a period of economic growth commenced, in the course of
which the per capita gross domestic product (with account of purchasing power
parity) demonstrateda 4.5-time increaseby 2012. Greenhousegas emissions also
increased fuel consumption and

the emissions increase rate is
signincantly lower than the GDP growth rate (Figure3). The averageannual GDP
growth during the 1995-2012 period was 7.9 per cent, while the average annual

carbon intensity of the economy during the period 1995-2012 decreased3.9 times;
this is the fastest rate of progress towards achieving low-carbon development

Figure 3 Dynamics of greenhousegas emissionsand gross domesticproduct

in 1995-2012 (a'atafor the 1995 is taken as 100per cent)

The country managedto considerably reduce greenhousegas emissions in
the past by effectively implementing measureswith relatively low marginal costs.
During the period of 1995-2005 on average 1.6 per cent of the GDP was spent on
improving energy efficiency, energy conservation and deployment of renewable
energy sources.In 2006-2010, theseinvestmentswere ashigh as3.4 per cent of the
GDP, and in 2011-2015 were 5 per cent. The share of state budget funds in these
investmentswas at least 30 per cent. This made it possible to rapidly approximate
to other developed countries with similar climates in terms, for example, of such
indicator as GDP energy intensity. Belarus has one of the lowest values in Europe
for the carbon intensity of its energy system - about 0.3 tons in COz-eq. for the
generationof one MWh of heat and electricity, thus approaching such countries as
Japanandthe USA regarding installed capacity utilization efnciency.

b)

Methodological Approaches
Taking into account Decision 24/CP.19 regarding the submission of these
commitments, the information on greenhousegas emissionsis basedon the use of
the following methodological guidelines:

— Revised Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,

1996(1997a, 1997b, 1997c).

IPCC,

— Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National

Greenhouse Gas Inventories,

IPCC, 2000 (2003 edition);

— lOO-year Global Warming Potential values from the IPCC Second

AssessmentReport.

The following models and methods were used for

the projection of

greenhousegasemissions:

— LEAP model

(Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning)

and

BALANCE (energy balance)model for the power sector;

— Correlation and regressionanalysis for other sectors.

Fairness and ambition

of the commitments

The Republic of Belarus is one of the UNFCCC Annex 1 countries and
therefore, along with other countries included in this Annex, has to bear the main
burden of commitments. The Republic of Belarus does not have additional
nnancial resourcesto acceleratethe adoption of best international practices and the
implementation of best available technologies. In the context of existing high
marginal costs and economic growth rates the ability of the country to mobilize
funds and secureadditional investment in low-carbon technologies is limited.

the Kyoto Protocol

During the entire first commitment period of

the
Republic of Belarus could not attract carbon funding becauseits assignedamount
of greenhousegasemissionswas not established(Amendment to Annex B adopted
by the Parties in Decision lO/CMP.2 was not ratified), and the prospectsfor using
instruments of the international carbon market in 2013-2020 are minimal
in the
context of the effect of Article 3, paragraph7 ter of the Doha Amendment adopted
by the Parties in Decision l/CMP.8.

However, the Republic of Belarus intends to continue reducing the carbon
intensity of its economy. The country acknowledges that in many sectors of the
economy there is still high potential for preventing climate change.In contrast to
the scenarios based on the existing development programmes, which imply
reductions of emissions by 20-22% in 2030 as compared to the base year,
according to some estimates it is possible to achieve an additional reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 25-30 million tonnes of COZ-eq.
during the period of 2015-2030, and the Republic of Belarus includes this
possibility in its commitments.

These commitments rely solely on the internal potential of the country and
are taken without any additional conditions regarding possible mobilization of
foreign funds for the implementation of best available technologies. Despite the
achievementsin economic development and development of the market economy,
the GDP (PPP) per capita remains one of the lowest among Annex 1 countries,
while the share of investment in capital assetsis insufficient to ensure expanded
production.

In theseconditions, the nationally determined contributions for mitigation of

climate changestatedby the Republic of Belarus are fair and ambitious.

Other

commitments

a)

Measures to increase carbon removals
Due to planned actions to ensure sustainableforest management,the forest
cover of the country increasedby 4.3% since 1990, and currently is continuing to
grow. According to the sector-specific forestry development programme, the
policy for increasing the resourcepotential of forests and ensuring the sustainable
forest use will be further implemented. In line with the priorities of the National
SustainableDevelopment Strategyof the Republic of Belarus until 2030, measures
will be implemented to increasethe area under forest from 39.4% in 2013 up to
41% in 2030.

Pursuant to the Strategy for the Implementation of

the United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious
Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa (approved by the Resolution
of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No.361 of 29.04.2015) the
Republic of Belarus in 2015-2030 will ensurethe environmental rehabilitation of at
least 10,000 ha of damagedbogs, thus increasing the area of restored peatlandsto
at least 60,000 ha by 2030 and reducing the area of degradedreclaimed land with
peat soils up to 190,000ha by 2030.

Pursuant to the Strategy for the Implementation of

the Convention on
Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (approved
by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No. 177 of
10.02.2009),the Republic of Belarus will undertakemeasuresto conservethe main
habitats of the populations of rare and endangeredwild animals and plant species
living or growing in wetlands, involving an area of at least 30,000 ha of open fen
mires, 40,000 ha of noodplain meadows, and 160,000 ha of
raised bogs and
transitional mires.

Pursuant to the National Strategy for the Development of the System of
Strictly Protected Areas until 2030 (approved by the Resolution of the Council of
Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No.649 of 02.07.2014) efforts will be madeto
ensure further conservation of natural ecosystems, biological and landscape
diversity, ensuring ecological balance of natural systems and sustainable use of
protectedareascovering at least 8.8% of the territory of the country.

b)

Adaptation Measures
Forestry and agriculture are the sectorsmost vulnerable to climate changein
the Republic of Belarus. Considering the signincant innuenceof climate changeon
the sustainabledevelopment of the economy, and the well-being and health of the
population of the country, the Republic of Belarus is formulating national policy
on the adaptation to climate changethrough the elaboration of national strategies,
sector-specinc and regional programmes and plans for adaptation to climate
changeand their subsequentimplementation. So far the Strategyfor the Adaptation
of Forestry to Climate Changeuntil 2050 has been developed.The Strategy for the
Adaptation of Agriculture to Climate Changeis currently being developed.

In 2016-2019 the legislative and institutional basis for climate change
adaptation will be formed, and mechanisms for the collection and transfer of
information,
fast response in emergency situations, accounting of current and
future risks related to climate change,inclusion of adaptationmeasuresinto sector-
specif1cprogrammes and programmes of the socioeconomic development of the
Republic of Belarus and its administrative territories will be developed.

In 2017-2030, programmes of adaptation actions and practices will be
developed

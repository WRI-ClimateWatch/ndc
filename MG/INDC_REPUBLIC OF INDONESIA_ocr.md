environment." As climate change becomes a reality, Indonesia must continue to seek a balance
between its current and future development and poverty,reduction priorities.

_

lndonesia's strategic development goals, known as the Nawacr'ta (or Nine Agenda Priorities),
charts the transitional path towards realizing meaningful and long-term changes, aligning
Indonesia's vision as a politically sovereign and economically self-reliant nation with deep roots
identity. These priorities are consistent with the national commitment to climate

cutting priorities of the National Medium-Tenn Development Plan. As the largest archipelagic

Given its pivotal geographic position in the global ocean conveyor belt

values and energy and mineral resources. Indonesia recognizes its role to play in combatling
global climate change. Nevertheless, Indonesia is also vulnerable to natural disasters that will
likely be exacerbated by climate change. especially in low-lying areas throughout
the
archipelago. Therefore Indonesia views integrated land- and ocean-based climate change
adaptation and mitigation efforts as a critical strategic consideration in achieving climate
resilience in food, water and energy.

For 2020 and beyond, Indonesia envisions achieving archipelagic climate resilience as a result
of comprehensive adaptation and mitigation programs and disaster risk reduction strategies.
Indonesia has set ambitious goals for sustainability related to production and consumption of
food. water. and energy. These goals will be achieved by supporting empowerment and

Mitigation

According to Indonesia's Second National Communication of 2010, national greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions were estimated to be 1,800 MtCOze in 2005. This represents an increase of
4.5,; .‘i'LCCEacompared to 2030. Most emissions {03%} are the result oi land use change and
peat and forest nres, with combustion of fossil fuels contributing approximately 19% of total
emissions. It is important to note that fossil energy resource extraction also contributes to land
use change emissions. The lndonesia baseline uses the business as usual scenario of emission
projections starting in 2010, based on historical trajectory (2000-2010), projected increases in
the energy sector and the absence of mitigation actions.

In 2009. Indonesia voluntarily pledged to reduce emissions by 26% on its own efforts, and up to
41% with international support, against the business as usual scenario by 2020. Since then
Indonesia has promulgated relevant legal and policy instruments, including the national action
plan on GHG emissions reduction as stipulated in Presidential Regulation (PERPRES) No.
6112011and GHG inventory through Presidential Regulation (PERPRES) No. 7112011.Beyond

Indonesia has taken signincant steps to reduce emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change

prohibiting conversion of peat lands from 2010-2016. Those ongoing efforts will be strengthened
through protection and conservation of its remaining forests by reducing deforestation and forest

The GOl has demonstrated its strong commitment to institutional development by establishing
the Directorate General of Climate Change. under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
Estabiished by Presidential Regulation No"16 of 2015, the Directorate General serves as the
National Focal Point for the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to effectively facilitate ongoing relevant programs
and processes being implemented by a variety of government sectors and stakeholders. Since
ctimate change has local to national and international dimensions, coordination and synergy will
continuously be enhanced between the Ministry of Environment and Forestry with Ministry of
National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) in the context of climate change and national
development and with Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the context of climate change and
international negotiations.

To further strengthen institutional capacity. Indonesia is developing appropriate legal
instruments for environmental protection and management, spatial pianning, renewable energy.

Indonesia's Vulnerability to Climate Change

ll.
As an archipelagic country with extensive low-lying and small island areas, Indonesia is highly
vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Indonesia has already experienced
extreme climate events such as noods and drought, and is anticipating long-term impacts from
sea level rise. As the Indonesian population grows, climate change-induced natural disasters
will affect a greater number of people and their assets. making it difncult for them to escape
poverty.

Climate change is believed to increase the risk for hydro-meteorological disasters, which make
up 80% of disaster occurrences in Indonesia. The poorest and most marginalized populations
tend to live in high-risk areas that are prone to nooding, landslides. sea level rise. and water
shortagesduring drought.

As the country with the second longest coastline in the world, Indonesia faces a high risk of
coastal inundation and sea level rise that may affect up to 42 million people living in low
elevation coastal zones. Most of these areas have experienced rapid urbanization, reaching
50% in 2010.

Indonesia's coastal zone is also affected by the rate of deforestation and

forest degradation. The loss of forest ecosystems leads to the loss of critical environmental
services, providing for water catchment areas, preventing erosion and floods, and protecting
againstthe loss of biodiversity.

In order for Indonesiato reduce its vulnerability to climate change. it must strengthen its climate
resilience by integrating its adaptation and mitigation efforts in development planning and
implementation.

lil. Priority Actions for Climate Resilience

in 2010 the Government of
Indonesia pledged to reduce emissions by 26% (41% with
international
support} against
the business as usual scenario by 2020.
The current
administration,under President Joitc Widodo‘ has determined priority actions within the national
News Cite (Nine Priority Agendas) framework. which includes protecting Indonesia's citizens,
encouraging rural and regional development. improving the quality of
life. and improving
productivity and global competitiveness.
These core missions are consistent with the national
commitment
in which climate change
adaptation and mitigation constitute an integrated and cross-cutting priority of
the National
Medium-Term Development Plan. The following priorities for enhanced actions in 2015-2019
will be fully integrated into Indonesia's National Medium-TermDevelopmentPlan in 2020.

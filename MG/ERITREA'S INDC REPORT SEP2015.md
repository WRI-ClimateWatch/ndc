Executive Summary 

Eritrea had ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 
1995.  Moreover,  as  follow  up  to  the  Warsaw  proposal  followed  by  the  Lima  call  for  climate 
action,  Eritrea  has  prepared  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (INDC)  for  the 
period 2020-2030with the view that global determination to tackle the effects of climate change 
calls for commitment from all parties with regard to mitigation, adaptation and implementation. 
 
In developing its INDC, Eritrea undertook a broad stakeholders representation and consultation 
processes.  This  process  allowed  for  the  baseline  assessment,  and  review  of  policies  and 
programs that are being implemented by the Government of the State of Eritrea to combat global 
warming and for the level of ambition to which the country wants to commit in its INDC.   
 
In the mitigation, the main gases covered are CO2, CH4 and N2O. Key sectors that contribute to the 
greenhouse  gases  emission  are:  Energy,  Transport,  Industry,  Waste,  Forestry  and  Agriculture.  
Vulnerable  sectors  to  impacts  of  climate  change  that  need  adaption  measures  include 
Agriculture, Marine resources, Health, water and land resources.  
 
In  2010,  the  total  greenhouse  gases  emission  estimated  using  the  GACMO  model  amounts  to 
ktCO2  3972,  whereas,  the  business  as  usual  scenario  of  GHGs  emission  in  the  year  2030 
isexpected to be ktCO2 6331. 

The  country  focussing  on  the  energy  sector  assumes  two  scenarios,  in  the  mitigation  of  the 
greenhouse gases emission plans for the next 15 years: reducing by 39.2% unconditionally and 
80.6  %  in  the  conditional  scenario  assuming  external  assistance  compared  to  the  business  as 
usual scenarios.  

The  INDCs  also  presents  concrete  measures  and  steps  that  need  to  be  taken  in  the 
implementation the projects and programs. These include, capacity building, technology transfer, 
financial  support  and  partnership  with  regional  and  international  agencies  involved  in  climate 
change. 
 
To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  INDC  program,  M  &  E  tools  are  proposed.  This 
includes periodic monitoring of the activities stipulated in the project documents so as to verify 
the right direction towards the intended outcome in mitigation and adaption.

1.  National Context 

1.1  Rationale and Process for Developing INDCs 
Eritrea is located in the Horn of Africa, lying between 12022′, and 18002′north and between 360 
26′  and  43013′east.  Sudan  borders  it  in  the  west,  Ethiopia  in  the  south,  Djibouti  in  the  south 
east, and the Red Sea in the east. The country has a total land area of 124,300 km2, and a coast 
line of 1900km. Eritrea's territorial waters in the Red Sea zone is about 120,000 km2. 
 
It  has  diversified  Eco  geographic  zones  that  provide  unique  habitat  for  the  marine  terrestrial 
fauna  and  flora.    In  2010,  the  population  of  Eritrea  was  estimated  to  be  3.2  million  with  an 
annual  population  growth  rate  of  2.9%,  comprising  of  65%  living  in  the  rural  areas.  The 
economic activity, for most of the population, mainly relies on rain fed agriculture and artisanal 
fisheries.  
 
Climatically 70% of the country is hot to very hot with annual mean temperatures of 270C; 20% 
is mild with temperature of 190C and the remaining 10% is cool with mean temperature of less 
than 190C. Eritrea is vulnerable to climate change and boththe marine and terrestrial ecosystems 
have  been  negatively  affected.Over  the  past  60  years  temperature  has  risen  by  approximately 
1.7OC  with  tremendous  impact  on  biodiversity  losses,  sea  level  rise  and  coral  bleaching  due  to 
increase  in  sea  water  temperature,  decline  in  food  production,  loss  of  biodiversity  and  overall 
loss of resilience of the ecosystem. Hence, the country plans to adapt climate smart technologies 
to  counteract  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change,  so  as  to  improve  the  health  and  social 
wellbeing of the population.  
 
Against  the  above  background,  the  purpose  of  the  preparation  of  the  INDCs  is  to  promote 
environmentally  sound,  socially  acceptable  and  climate  resilient  economic  development  by 
following low-carbon development path and increasing adapting capacity to the adverse impacts 
of climate change.  
 
Under paragraph 14 of the Lima Call for Climate Action, countries were invited to describe how 
their  intended  nationally  determined  contribution  "contributes  to  the  achievement  of  the 
objective of the Convention" (UNFCCC 2014). The latest climate science shows what needs to be 
happening  globally  in  order  to  have  a  probably  chance  of  limiting  warming  to  20C,  the  goal 
adopted by the UNFCCC. Global emissions must peak by 2020, and net GHG emissions must be 
phased out over the Long term. This will require all major emitting regions to make substantial 
reductions  below  their  projected  baseline  business-as-usual  emissions  over  the  course  of  this 
century.  Cumulative  global  emissions  must  remain  within  the  carbon  budget,  which  is  the 
maximum amount of cumulative carbon the world can emit to have a probably chance of limiting 
warming to 20C.

1.2 Summary of climate change trends, impacts and vulnerabilities 
The rainfall regime varies in space and time. It ranges from 50mm along the coastal area to 1000 
mm in smaller area along the eastern escarpment; 50% of the country receive less than 300mm; 
40% 300-600mm, and  10% greater than 600mm. Hence, by virtue of its geographical location, 
Eritrea  is  prone  to  climatic  variability  i.e.  recurrent  droughts,  (decrease  in  amount  of  rainfall 
from  550  to  400mm  in  the  highlands),  changes  in  seasonality    that  had  resulted  frequent  crop 
failure, massive death of livestock, genetic erosion, extinction of endemic species, degradation of 
habitats and disequilibria in the ecosystem structure and function.  
 
The impact of climate change is manifested in recurrent droughts, desertification, sea level rise 
and increase in sea water temperature, depletion of ground water, widespread land degradation, 
and  emergence  of  climate  sensitive  diseases.  The  combined  net  effect  has  resulted  in  food 
insecurity. 
 
Eritrea  is  committed  to  gender  equity  and  social  justice.  30%  of  the  National  Assembly  is 
composed of women. 
 
Increased  climate  variability  has  already  been  evidenced  in  Eritrea.  Eritrea  has  experienced 
frequent and recurrent droughts since the early 1920s which has aggravated food insecurity and 
poverty.  The  spread  of  malaria  in  the  highlands,  which  has  never  been  experienced  before, 
desertification  and  decline  in  biodiversity  have  also  been  witnessed.  A  number  of  recent 
assessments have revealed that observed climate change already has serious impacts on socio-
economic systems and livelihoods of the country.

1.3 Existing Policies and Legal Framework Related to Climate Change 
As  Shown  in  Table  1  Eritrea  has  already  developed  various  macro  and  micro  polices  and  legal 
instruments,  plans,  guidelines  and  communication  documents  which  have 
important 
contribution to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.  Eritrea has prepared its INDC 
based on these national documents.

2.  National Development Goals and Priorities 

Eritrea intends to undertake mitigation and adaptation initiatives to reduce the vulnerability of 
its population, environment and economy to the adverse effects of climate change, based on its 
Climate Resilient Sustainable Economy Development policy for addressing both climate change 
adaptation and mitigation goals. This would ensure a resilient economic development pathway 
and in the long run, Eritrea envisages achieving its goals of becoming climate change responsive 
country with equitable economic growth by ensuring a rapid transition to low-carbon economy. 
 
To this end, Eritrea intends to raise the share of electricity generation from renewable energy to 
70% of the total electricity generation mix (wind, solar and geothermal). Moreover it intends to 
reduce  transmission  and  distribution  losses  at  least  by  50%.  On  the  other  hand  to  enhance 
energy  conservation  it  is  intended  to  introduce:  rail  transportation  to  cover  about  400km  for 
mass transportation of freight with estimated cost of about USD 1billion and uses of big buses for 
passenger transport to a long distance.

3.3 Trajectory Objective Towards 2030 
The government of the State of Eritrea is committed to reduce the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels 
by  23.1%  in  2020,  30.2  %  by  2025  and  39.2%  by  2030  visa-vis  to  the  reference  year.    If 
additional support is solicited, it can be further reduced by 36.4 % in 2020, 61.1% by 2015 and 
80.6% by 2030.  
 
The BAU scenario for all GHG gases expected to increase to: 5 MtCO2eq in 2020, 5.5 MtCO2eq in 
2025 and in 2030 6.3 MtCO2eq. Therefore, Eritrea intends to limit its net greenhouse gas (GHGs) 
emissions  in  2030  to  less  than  3.9  MtCO2eq.  This  would  constitute  a  39%  reduction  from  the 
projected  ‘business‐as‐usual'  (BAU)  emissions  in  2030  or  80.6%  reduction  from  the  reducible 
BAU scenario in 2030 as shown in Figure 1. 
 
The  BAU  scenario  for  all  fossil  fuel  CO2  emission  expected  to  increase  1.7  MtCO2  in  2020,  2.2 
MtCO2in 2025 and in 2030, 3 MtCO2. 

3.4  Unconditional Mitigation Measures 
Unconditional mitigation scenario: With internal resources Eritrea can implement its 
unconditional scenario reaching 1.3 MtCO2 in 2020, 1.6 MtCO2 in 2025 and 1.9 MtCO2 in 
2030from fossil fuel CO2. 

3.5  Conditional Mitigation Measures 
Conditional mitigation scenario: With external assistances Eritrea can implement its conditional 
scenario reaching 1.1 MtCO2 In  2020, 0.9 MtCO2  in 2025 and 0.6 MtCO2 in 2030from fossil fuel 
CO2.

3.6 Accounting Methodologies  
The  methodology  used  to  estimate  CH4  and  N2O  emissions  were  calculated  based  on  IPCC 
guidelines of 2006 Volume 4 and Good Practice Guidance (GPG) 2003 and emissions from waste 
and industrial process was taken from the Second National Communication (SNC). The basis for 
the  calculation  of  the  emission  reduction  is  the  projection  of  GHGs  from  the  2010  inventory 
using  the  GACMO  model  (2015).  The  GACMO  model  was  also  used  to  calculate  the  abatement 
potential and corresponding investment requirement.

3.7 Fairness, Equity and Ambition 
Eritrea  in  its  policy  encourages  environmentally  sound  technologies  to  reduce  the  greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  It  has  committed  itself  and  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  low-carbon  and 
climate-resilient  development  pathway  to  achieve  its  development  aspirations.  The  focus  is  to 
create  a  climate-resilient  economy  while  contributing  to  the  GHGs  emission  reduction  up  to 
80.6% of the emissions from fossil fuels. Moreover, the Eritrean energy sector also emphasis on 
the use and introduction of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal power 
to substitute efficiency improvement measures the fossil fuel dependency.  

Eritrea makes a formal commitment to limit the growth of GHG emission despite only emitting 
less  than  0.01%  of  the  global  GHG  emissions  in  2010.  In  the  Business  As  Usual  as  of  2030  its 
emission is only about 1.15 t CO2 -eq/capita or 0.31 tCO2-eq/US$. 
 
 

4.  Eritrea's Adaptation Contributions 

4.1 Planning Strategies 
4.1.1  Agricultural  and Forestry  Development: Over  70% of Eritrea's  population  depends on 
agriculture and natural resources for its livelihoods. The population directly depends on land for 
crop  and  livestock  production;  and  exploits  the  forests  to  extract  wood  and  non-wood  forest 
products  including  wild  fruits  and  vegetables  to  supplement  the  diet  of  the  households. 
Nonetheless,  for  most  parts  of  the  year,  the  population  remains  food  insecure  as  the  result  of 
climate change and land degradation.  
 
Consequent to recurrent droughts, desertification coupled with inappropriate land use practices 
has  significantly  contributed  to  the  attrition  of  the  natural  resources-base.  Consequently,  the 
natural  resources-  base  is  failing  to  deliver  the  desired  level  of  production  to  support  the 
population.  To  arrest  land  degradation  and  hence  to  adapt  climate  change  measures  are 
underway to rehabilitate degraded land and protect forest from deforestation. Moreover, Eritrea 
has been undertaking vigorous efforts to enhance Climate Smart Agriculture.  
 
4.1.2 Water resources development: Being located in drought-prone areas of Africa as well as 
its  geological  formation,  Eritrea  isn't  endowed  with  both  ground  and  surface  water  potential. 
Hence, water is a vital natural resource that deserves special attention. 
 
In the area of water resources, adaptations to climate change focuses on the implementation of 
solar powered improved water systems interventions and provides clean and adequate water to 
all  and  assure  efficient  utilization  of  national  water  resources  in  all  sectors  and  achieve 
sustainable  development.  Eritrea  planned  to  achieve  effective  and  efficient  water  resources 
assessment, development and management tools and plans.

4.1.3  Land  Resource  Management:  Being  the  most  critical  resources  upon  which  the 
livelihoods  for  the  rural  population  of  Eritrea  depends,  its  conservation  from  all  forms  of 
degradation  is  the  priority  of  the  government.  To  that  end,  effective  policy  measures  have 
already  been  taken  to  develop  and  enhance  effective  land  cover,  land  capability  and  land 
classification system in the country to enhance its adaptive capacity to climate change. 
 
4.1.4  Public  Health:  Climate  change  has  direct  impact  on  the  public  health.  Due  to  climate 
change, there are indications of emergence of Malaria and Dengue Fever which, in the past, was 
confined  to  the  lowlands  has  started  to  appear  in  highlands.  To  tackle  the  emerging  climate 
related  diseases  and  public  health  problems,  Eritrea  has  been  undertaking  various  integrated 
programs. 
 
4.1.5  Marine  Resources  Development:  As  Eritrea  is  coastal  state,  climate  change  has  direct 
impact  on  the  development  of  marine  resources.  In  the  major  cities,  efforts  are  underway  to 
monitor the  sea level  rise, increase  sea water temperature and acidity. In  this regard, the state 
has  introduced  and  plans  to  promote  an  Integrated  Coastal  Marine  and  Islands  Resources 
Management System through enforcement of policy measures and legal frameworks. 
 
Promote sustainable  fishing techniques through training and, equipping with boats  and fishing 
gear.  This  will  ensure  adequate  protection  and  sustainable  exploitation  of  Eritrea's  coastal, 
marine and island resources and the development of the fisheries sector.

5.1 Financial Needs 
5.1.1 Mitigation 
The full and effective implementation of the Climate resilient Economy Strategy Eritrea requires 
an estimated expenditure  of more  than USD  1,086 million  by 2030. This indicates the  need for 
major capital investments. Therefore, the types of contributions required to implement Eritrea's 
INDC are categorized into unsupported and supported contributions.  
 
                         Table 3: Eritrea's Investment needs for mitigation measures 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.2 Adaptation 
Unconditionally,  the  Government  of  the  State  of  Eritrea  already  spends  a  huge  portion  of  its 
annual  budget  on  infrastructure  (construction  of  dams,  roads)  and  the  provision  of  social 
services (schools and hospitals), which contribute to addressing the negative impacts of climate 
change by reducing emissions and vulnerabilities of its people and the environment. On the other 
hand,  the  implementation  of  Eritrea's  INDCs  requires  sustainable  and  reliable  support  in  the 
form of finance, capacity building and technology transfer.

Apart from the unconditionally planned adaptation measures, Eritrea would further increase it 
by 60% provided funding is secured from regional and international financial agencies.

Cumulative budget  (USD) 

Over the coming 15 years Eritrea needs total investment in the conditional scenarios of USD 7.2 
billion.This  includes  15%  of  the  total  budget  will  be  required  for  governance  and  capacity 
building  across  all  sectors  for  effective  implementation  of  both  adaptation  and  mitigation 
programs.

5.2 Capacity Building 
The  implementation  of  the  abovementioned  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions  for  the  period 
2020  -  2030  requires  the  continuous  development  and  strengthening  of  Eritrea's  capacities. 
Therefore,  it  is  imperative  to  consolidate  platforms  for  the  exchange  of  knowledge  and 
information  related  to  adaptation  at  all  levels  of  government,  as  well  as  to  strengthen  the 
networks with academic institutions and civil society.  
 
Furthermore, it  is  fundamental to incorporate  gender  issues into  capacity building, prioritizing 
the most vulnerable sectors and regions in order to reduce social inequality and the gap between 
women  and  men  rights.  Capacity  building  requires  cooperation  from  developed  countries  to 
developing countries as well as south-south cooperation to enhance regional cooperation.  

5.3 Community participation 
At  the  local  level,  direct  community  participations  are  imperative.  Hence,  sensitisation  and 
mobilization  of  the  local  communities  at  all  levels  is  a  pre-requisite  for  a  success.  It  is  also 
important  to  mainstreaming  climate  related  topics  to  be  included  in  the  national  educational 
system to make aware the school children about the risks of climate change. 
 
Awareness rising about  the  adverse impacts  of climate risks through various means,  inter alia, 
the  radio,  television  broadcasting,  documentary  films  and  press  help  to  instil  climate-related 
topics and issues to the public. 
 
5.4 Research and development (Time series data and scientific research) 
Mitigation  and  adaption  measures  are  subject  to  continuous  scrutiny;  and  for  that  time  series 
data and scientific research are required to effectively quantify or estimate the outcomes of the 
interventions. For that there is a dire need for exchange of information and data is required for 
the areas covered in all the sectors.There is need for mainstreaming of climate change issues into 
the national development plans and strategies. 
 
5.5 Technology Transfer Needs 
Mitigation  and  adaption  require  the  introduction  of  climate  smart  technologies.  These  require 
the  transfer  of  technology  from  the  developed  to  the  developing  countries  to  effectively  and 
efficiently  introduce  in  the  proposed  measures.  In  that  direction,  future  research  and 
development will focus on: 
1. Quantification and assignment of the share of unsupported contributions that are planned and 

fully funded by the government to limit the quantity of emissions; 

2.  Quantification  and  assign  the  share  of  supported  contributions  that  are  planned  by  the 

government but require international support to limit the quantity of emissions; 

3.  Identification  of  the  technical  support  needed  to  introduce  new  and  additional  policies  and 

actions that stimulate and enable investment in limiting emission to 0.6 Mt or lower.

At  the  national  level,  for  effective  and  efficient  implementation  of  the  mitigation  and  adaption 
measures, there is a need for synergetic efforts across the various sectors directly involved in the 
planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of programmes and projects. 
 
Furthermore, Eritrea requires international support for the development of its own technologies 
as well as for technology transfer and innovation to increase its adaptive capacity.  
 
For Eritrea, the increase of investment in disaster prevention is of utmost relevance, as well as 
the development of an insurance market against hydro meteorological and catastrophic risks, in 
which the private sector is invited and expected to play a relevant role. 
 

6.  Planning Strategies/Institutional Arrangements Implementation 

The Eritrean INDCs is prepared based on existing sustainable development strategies, plans and 
objectives  aligned  with  national  development  plans.  It  was  developed  with  active  stakeholder 
engagement  and  with  full  commitment  of  government  officials  at  all 
levels.  Hence, 
implementation of INDCs will be in line with existing plans, strategies, policies, legal frameworks 
as  described  in  table  1.  To  enhance  the  implementation,  moreover,  continuous  updating  and 
reporting of climate related national documents such as National Communications (NC), Biennial 
Update Reports (BUR), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA), and National Adaption 
Plan (NAP) will be prepared.  

 

7.  Monitoring and Reporting Progress 

The  State  of  Eritrea  through  the  Ministry  of  Land,  Water  and  Environment  has  the  full 
responsibility  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  INDCs  through  regular 
stakeholders  consultative  engagement.  This  will  ensure 
the  effective  updating  and 
implementation of both mitigation adaption plans.

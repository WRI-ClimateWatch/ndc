<meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'>  Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) towards the achievement 

of the global goal of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 

(UNFCCC) by the Republic of Tajikistan 

 
The  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  pursuant  to  the  relevant  decisions  of  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties  (COP)  to  the  UNFCCC,  COP-19  and  COP-20  of  the  UNFCCC,  including  the  Lima 
Call for Action to Combat Climate Change (Lima, Peru, December 2014), submits herewith 
its 
Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (INDC)  and  the  explanations 
concerned. 
 
The final decision concerning the INDC of the Republic of Tajikistan within the framework of 
a  new  global  climate  change  agreement,  which  will  be  proposed    for    signing  during  the 
COP-21 (Paris, France, December 2015), is expected to be taken with due account for the 
outcomes of the negotiating process at this meeting. 

The INDC of the Republic of 
Tajikistan with respect to the 
reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions and the impact on the 
climate system, subject to  new 
substantial international funding  
and technology transfer   
 

 

The  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  as  a  mountainous  and  landlocked  country  with  a  developing 
economy  and  low  per  capita  GDP,  is  characterized  by  the  low  level  of  gross  and  specific 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  an  extreme  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  including 
frequent natural disasters. More than 60% of the water resources of the Central Asia Region, 
which  originate  from  the  high  mountain  glaciers,  are  generated  in  the  country.  Tajikistan 
adheres  to  the  policy  of  sustainable  development.  Since  independence,  fundamental 
regulatory  and  legal  instruments,  national  strategies  and  programmes  have  been  adopted 
and  the  key  environmental  international  conventions  and  agreements  have  been  ratified,   
serving  on  a  global  scale  as  a  safeguard  towards  preservation  of  the  natural  environment 
and  preventing  ecological  disasters.  With  the  assistance  of  the  international  institutions, 
measures are being developed and implemented to fulfil the commitments which have been 
made  in  accordance  with  the  UN  environmental  conventions,  and  the  relevant  institutional 
structures are established.   
 
The Republic of Tajikistan is a participating country of the international Pilot Programme for 
Climate Resilience (PRCR). At the time of preparation of the INDC, the main efforts of the 
PPCR in the Republic of Tajikistan are focused on hydraulic power industry, development of 
other renewable sources of energy, agriculture and forestry, adequate response to and risk 
reduction  against  natural  disasters,  provision  of  hydrometerological  services,  as  well  as 
measures to raise public awareness.

A  flexible  target,  not  exceeding  80-90%  of  the  1990 
level by 2030, which amounts to 1.7-2.2 tons in CO2 
equivalent  per  capita,  has  been  determined  as  the 
country's  contribution  to  anthropogenic  greenhouse 
gas  emission  reductions.  Systematic  reforestation  in 
accordance  with  the  adopted  State  programmes  is  a 
considerable  contribution  of 
the 
reduction of negative impacts on the climate system. 
 
The potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
in the Republic of Tajikistan to achieve a target of 65-
75%  of  the  1990  level  by  2030,  which  amounts  to 
1.2-1.7  tons  in  CO2  equivalent  per  capita.  It  will  be 
possible  in  case  of  implementation  of  investment 
projects  and  national  programmes  in  the  sphere  of 
power industry, transport, agriculture and forestry and 
water  resources  management,  risk  reduction  of 
natural  disasters,  promotion  and  diversification  of 
renewable  energy  sources  and  reduction  of  energy

for  2012-2020;  National  Strategy 

Reduction  of  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  dangerous 
weather  events  and  climate  change  will  be  ensured 
by: modernization of the hydrometeorological services 
and improvement of the process of serving the needs 
of the economy and of the citizens; implementation of 
the  Medium-Term  Development  Programme  of  the 
Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  period  2016-2020; 
Agriculture  Reform  Programme  of  the  Republic  of 
Tajikistan for 2012-2020; State Programme for Study 
and  Preservation  of  Glaciers    of  the  Republic  of 
Tajikistan 
for  2010-2030;  State  Development 
Programme  of  Geology  Industry  of  the  Republic  of

for 
Disaster  Risk  Management  of 
the  Republic  of 
Tajikistan for 2009-2015; National Plan for Emergency 
Preparedness  and  Response  of  the  Republic  of 
Tajikistan and other sectoral programmes.   .  
 
It is important to bear in mind that for several reasons 
the  planned  and  approved  State  programmes  and 
strategies are not fully implemented due to the lack of 
financial resources. In the future it will be important to 
ensure  mobilization  of  additional  external  resources 
and  enhancement  of  scientific  and 
technical 
assistance  to  ensure  the  full-fledged  implementation 
of these and other important programmes.

The Republic of Tajikistan has one of the lowest levels 
of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  but,  in  spite  of  a  high 
share  of  renewable  power  generation,  it  faces  acute 
power  shortages  against  the  background  of  the 
economy  and  population  growth.  Since  1991,  at  the 
initial stage of the period of state independence, and 
especially  during the  period  1992-2000, the  Republic 
of  Tajikistan  had  experienced  grave  consequences 
resulting  from  civil  war  and  of  the  transition  from  a 
centrally planned to a market-based economy, with a 
sharp  increase  in  poverty.  During  the  period  2008-

Why the INDC is fair and 
ambitious, taking into account 
national peculiarities  

 

and  a  very  high  share  of  hydro-power  (more  than 
90%),  the  level  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  the 
Republic of Tajikistan will amount to 80-90% by 2030, 
as compared to 1990 (as stated in the INDC); this will 
ensure  the  achievement  of  socially  acceptable  and 
scientifically grounded indicators, both in absolute and 
per  capita  terms.  By  doing  so,  the  Republic  of 
Tajikistan  adheres  to  the  basic  principle  of  the 
UNFCCC - common but differentiated responsibility - 
and  expects  an  adequate 
reducing 
level  of 
greenhouse  gas  emissions 
from  economically 
developed countries and the largest countries-emitters 
of  greenhouse  gases  in  accordance  with  the  IPCC 
scientific recommendations to prevent global warming 
of  more  than  2°С.  The  international  support  of  the 
intentions of the Republic of Tajikistan with respect to 
reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  a  full-
scale 
implementation  of  climate  adaptation  and 
resilience  measures  will  enable  the  country  to  be 
strongly  on  track  to  green  economy  and  climate-
resilient  development.  The  forests  and  gardens  in 
Tajikistan  are  of  critical 
the 
preservation of mountain ecosystems and biodiversity, 
improvement  of  the  state  of  lands  and  prevention  of 
their  further  degradation,  protection  of  vulnerable 
infrastructure,  protection  of  water  resources  and 
carbon  absorption from  the  atmosphere.  That  is  why 
they play a specific role both in terms of mitigating the 
impact  of  anthropogenic  activity  on  the  climate  and 
reducing negative consequences.  
 
The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, 
as  compared  to  1990,  by  its  own  and  ongoing  joint 
efforts, as well as at the expense of         additional 
new funding and technology transfer on the part of the 
international  community,  will  enable  the  country  to 
take 
"green" 
development which is consistent with the Convention's 
goal  -  to  prevent  global  warming  of  more  than  2°С. 
The  achievement  of  such  an  ambitious  goal  is  only 
possible  by  means  of  substantial  and  differentiated 
efforts of all countries that are in support of a new and 
ambitious climate agreement within the UNFCCC.

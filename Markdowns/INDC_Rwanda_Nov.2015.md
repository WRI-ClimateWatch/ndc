REPUBLIC OF RWANDA 

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (INDC) FOR THE REPUBLIC OF 

RWANDA 

INTRODUCTION 
Rwanda, known as the "land of a thousand hills"  is a landlocked country of 26,338 square 
kilometres,  geographically  located  in  Central  Africa  between  1°04'  and  2°51'  of  south 
latitude and between 28°45' and 31°15' of east longitude1. The country has seen significant 
economic development in recent years, with GDP growing at an average of over 8% annually 
over  the  last  decade  and  targeted  to  reach  11.5  %  under  the  medium  term  development 
implementation  framework  EDPRS  II2.  It  has  a  population  of  10,515,973  people3  which  is 
growing  at  2.8%  per  year.  Important  to  note  however  is  that  Rwanda's    fertility  rate  has 
reduced from 6.1 in 2005 to 4.2 in 2014  and that food crop production growth has grown 
more  twice  that  of  the  population  between  2007  and  2014  while  per  capita  income  has 
tripled  from  US$  211  in  2001  to  US$  718  in  20144.  A  vision  for  2050  based  on  the  Green 
Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy envisages Rwanda as a developed climate-resilient, 
low  carbon  economy,  with  a  strong  services  sector,  low  unemployment  and  low  levels  of 
poverty.  It  would  be  a  country  where  agriculture  and  industry  have  a  minimal  negative 
impact  on  the  environment,  operating  in  a  sustainable  way,  and  enabling  self-sufficient 
basic necessities for all living in it. By 2050, development will be achieved with low carbon 
domestic  energy  resources  and  practices,  reducing  the  country's  contribution  to  climate 
change  while  allowing  it  to  be  independent  of  imported  oil  for  power  generation.  Finally, 
Rwanda will have the robust local and regional knowledge to be able to respond and adapt 
to changes in the climate and the resulting impacts. 
 
Rwanda  is  pleased  to  submit  this  INDC  to  replace  the  preliminary  INDC  submitted  to  the 
Convention  in  September  2015.  This  affirms  the  country's  commitment  to  engage  in  the 
forthcoming international process of developing a climate change agreement.

in  2003.  The  country  submitted 

Rwanda  has  been  committed  to  addressing  the  challenge  of  climate  change  since  1998 
when  it  ratified  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC) 
and 
its  Initial  National 
Communication to the UNFCCC in 2005, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) 
in  2006,  and  the  Second  National  Communication 
in  2012.  The  Third  National 
Communication is under preparation. 
 
Rwanda's  INDC  is  built  upon  its  National  Strategy  for  Climate  Change  and  Low  Carbon 
Development  Strategy.  The  full  implementation  of  this  strategy  rests  upon  five  enabling 
pillars: Institutional Arrangements; Finance; Capacity Building and Knowledge Management; 
Technology, Innovation and Infrastructure; and Integrated Planning and Data Management. 
 
ADAPTATION CONTRIBUTION 
Rationale

adaptation 
contribution 

and 
for 

Rwanda is highly vulnerable to climate change, as it is strongly reliant on rain-fed 
agriculture  both  for  rural  livelihoods  and  for  exports  of  mainly  tea  and  coffee. 
With the highest population density in Africa5, adaptation concerns are central to 
the  INDC.  In  recent  years,  extreme  weather  events  in  Rwanda  increased  in 
frequency  and  magnitude  what,  in  some  parts  of  the  country,  led  to  significant 
losses including human lives6. Floods and landslides were increasingly reported in 
the  high  altitude  Western  and  Northern  Provinces,  whereas  droughts  made 
severe damages in the Eastern Province7. 
Rwanda  has  experienced  a  temperature  increase  of  1.4°C  since  19708,  higher 
than the global average, and can expect an increase in temperature of up to 2.0°C 
by the 2030s from 1970. Rainfall is highly variable in Rwanda but average annual 
rainfall may increase by up to 5-10% by the 2030s from 19709. This is expected to 
lead  to  increasing  rainfall  intensity, leading  to  a  higher  frequency  of  floods  and 
storms  resulting 
losses,  health  risks,  and  damage  to 
infrastructure, as well as an increase in temperatures resulting in proliferation of 
diseases, crop decline and reduced land availability that impacts on food security 
and export earnings.

The priority  adaptation actions have  been  identified  in  Rwanda's  Green Growth 
and  Climate  Resilient  Strategy  (2011),  are  on-going  and  will  be  partially  or  fully 
achieved by 2050. Many of the actions specified under the sectors programmes 
have both mitigation and adaptation benefits.

Seasonal  shortages  of  food  supply  as  a 
result  of  poor  harvests  caused  by 
droughts  and  flooding  and  soil  erosion 
are  among  the  most  significant  signs  of 
how the agriculture sector is vulnerable 
to  climate  change  in  Rwanda.    In  order 
to  adapt  to  this  situation,  Rwanda 
intends  to  mainstream  agro  ecology 
technologies  in  its  current  agriculture

Rwanda  intends  to  promote  recovery 
and  reuse  of  both  organic  waste  and 
wastewater  in  order  to  restore  and 
maintain soil fertility. Organic waste use 
through composting, currently used at a 
small  scale,  will  be  implemented  to 
reach  100%  of  the  households  involved 
in  agriculture  production  countrywide 
by 2030. Waste water irrigation, mainly 
practiced  in  correction  centers  under 
national  prisons 
services  will  be 
implemented countrywide by 2030. 
Rwanda  relies  on  imported  inorganic 
fertilisers 
agriculture 
intensification  activities.  For  instance, 
36000  Mt  of  these  were  imported  in 
2014  and  these  importations  are  likelly 
to increase in the near future. Although 
good at  increasing yields, intensive use 
of 
fertilisers  has  adverse 
impacts  to  the  environment  in  general 
and  climate  change  in  particular.  In 
contrast, the use of organic fertilisers by 
composting  has  many  environmental 
benefits  whereby 
it  provides  an 
excellent  way  to  manage  the  huge 
volume of organic waste and utilise it in 
a productive manner.   
The effectiveness of composted organic 
waste  can  be  further 
improved  by 
enriching and blending it with nutrients 
(Nitrogen  phosphorus).  This  technique 
ensures  a  more  efficient  use  of 
inorganic  fertilizers,  and  adds  valuable 
organic  matter  to  soils,  which  also 
maximizes  terrestrial  carbon  in  farm 
soils. Rwanda intends to ensure the use 
of  fertilizer  enriched  compost  and  shift 
from  using  pure  inorganic  fertilizers  by

Increasing 
changes 
in  precipitation  and  water 
shortage  are  seen  as  climate  change 
aspects that result in pests and diseases 
proliferation. 
In  order  to  adapt  to  this,  Rwanda 
intends  to  promote  sustainable  pest 
management 
that 
incorporates  a  cropping  system  based 
on  producing  multiple  crop  and  fodder 
yields  but  which  is  also  designed  to 
control  plant  parasites  and  pathogens 
such  as  stemborers  and  striga  weed. 
Rwanda  also 
implement 
push-pull system using Napier grass and 
desmodium  legume  to  manage  pests 
under maize, sorghum, millets and rain-
fed 
The  main 
adaptation  benefits  of  the  push-pull 
system  are  the  increase  of  yields,  soil 
fertility  improvement  through  nitrogen 
fixation     and  provision of  a  continuous 
supply  of  fodder  to  cattle  from  the 
harvest of Napier grass and desmodium. 
Thisimproves  milk  yields  of  cattle  while 
reducing methane emissions as a result 
of improved fodder regimes. 
90% of Rwanda's crop land is on slopes 
ranging  from  5  to  50%  which  makes  it 
vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts 
like  soil  erosion  leading  to  permanent 
fertility loss. Rwanda  intends to expand 
its soil conservation and land husbandry 
programmes trough: 
Installation of land protection structures 
like  radical  and  progressive  terraces 
where  these  structures will  be  installed 
on 100% of the relevant area by 2030;

The  Rwandan  forestry  sector  provides 
the  main  part  of  the  primary  energy

population. Since 2002, there have been 
consistent gap in wood products supply 
and  demand  with  deficits  reaching  12 
million cubic meters in 2009. This deficit 
shows how the forest sector is and likely 
to  remain  under  pressure.In  order  to

Fairness,  equity 
and ambition 

Rwanda  is  part  of  the  Least  Developed  Countries  and  has  a  low  human 
development  index  according  to  the  Human  Development  Report  2014.  The 
country is still facing social and economic challenges addressed in the Economic 
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (2013 - 2018). 
 
Adaptation  is  the  first  priority  of  the  country  due  to  high  vulnerability  of  key 
economic activities such as agriculture, energy and forestry. In addition, Rwanda 
has  one of  the  lowest  GHG  emissions per  capita  in the  world  estimated at  0.99 

 

Rwanda INDCs - November  2015 - Page 22 of 24 

tCO2eq/person  (2013)15.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  net  emissions  of 
Rwanda as per second national communication (emissions net of sequestration) 
were negative in 2005. 
 
Despite  this,  Rwanda  has  established  mitigation  targets  in  different  sectors 
through  its  Green  Growth  and  Climate  Resilience  Strategy  and  mainstreamed 
Green Economy in its Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy. In 
this context, Rwanda considers that its Contribution is equitable and ambitious. 
 
Rwanda's  INDC  has  been  developed  taking  into  consideration  various  national 
guiding  documents,  including  Green  Growth  and  Climate  Resilience  Strategy 
(2011),  Vision  2020,  Economic  Development  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  2 
(2013 - 2018), Sustainable Energy for All (2015 - 2030), and others. 
 
The  development  of  this  INDC  was  achieved  through  a  participatory  and 
transparent process through stakeholder consultations and workshops. 
 
The  Government  of  Rwanda  already  spends  a  substantial  portion  of  its  annual 
budget on infrastructure and the provision of social services, which contribute to 
low carbon and build climate resilience. However, the full implementation of this 
INDC  will  require  predictable,  sustainable  and  reliable  support  in  the  form  of 
finance, capacity building and technology transfer.  
 
The  initial  costing  of  implementing  the  green  growth  and  climate  resilience 
strategy indicated that Rwanda will need 24.15 Billion USD in the sector of Water 
resource  management,  Agriculture  and  Energy  up  to  203016.  Costing  of  the 
remaining sectors will give the clear indication of financial needs. 
 
Rwanda  successfully  completed 
its  Technology  Needs  Assessment  (TNA).  
Elements of Rwanda's TNA process included institutional arrangements for TNA, 
extensive  stakeholders'  involvement  and  consultations,  prioritization  of  sectors, 
barrier/market analysis and Technology Action Plans (TAP). Prioritized sectors in 
Rwanda's TNA were agriculture and energy.   
 
The  Republic  of  Rwanda  through  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  hold  the 
responsibility  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  INDCs  through 
regular 
the 
Environment and Natural Resources Joint Sector Review (JSR) meetings. This will

ensure  the  effective  updating  and  implementation  of  both  mitigation  and 
adaptation plans. 
At  the  institutional  level,  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  (MINIRENA)  is  the 
Ministry  responsible  for  formulating  and  monitoring  national  policies  related  to 
climate  change  and  environment,  while  the  Rwanda  Environment  Management 
Authority  (REMA)  is  the  official  organ  responsible  for  implementing  national 
policies and strategies related to climate change and environment. 
 
A  successful  implementation  of  this  INDC  requires  a  close  coordination  and 
collaboration between MINIRENA, REMA and all potential stakeholders incuding 
the  private  sector,  civil  society  and  public  institutions  including  Ministry  of 
Agriculture and Animal Resources, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of 
Local Government, the Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Education, Ministry 
of  Health,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Planning,  Ministry  of  Disaster 
Management  and  Refugee  Affairs,  Rwanda  Meteorology  Agency,  National 
Institute  of  Statistics,  Rwanda  Development  Board,  Rwanda  Standards  Board, 
Rwanda  Agriculture  Board;  Rwanda  Energy  Group;  Water  and  Sanitation 
Corporation;  Rwanda  Natural  Resources  Authority;  Rwanda  Biomedical  Centre; 
Rwanda  Transport  Development  Agency;  Rwanda  Housing  Authority;  Rwanda 
Revenue  Authority;  National  Industrial  Research  and  Development  Agency; 
research centers and Universities. 
 
In  order  to  coordinate  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  adaptation  and 
mitigation  actions  in  the  different  sectors,  Rwanda  has  set  up  different  bodies 
and  operationalized  institutional  arrangements,  namely  the  Green  Economy 
Technical  Coordinating Committee  and    the  National  Fund for Environment  and  
Climate  change  (FONERWA)  as  a  national  green  fund  to  mobilize  additional 
internal  and  external  climate funds.  In addition,  MINIRENA has been  accredited 
as implementing entity for Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund (GCF) while 
REMA  has  been  nominated  as  national  designated  authority  for  GCF.  These 
institutions  are  based  on  a  sectorwide  approach  and  work  closely  with 
development partners, civil society, academia and the private sector. 
The  Government  of  Rwanda  intends  to  sell  carbon  credits  during  the  period  to 
contribute towards  achieving  its  Green  Growth and  Climate  Resilience Strategy. 
Rwanda  will  also  participate 
international  emissions  reduction 
mechanisms  such  as  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  Nationally 
Appropriate  Mitigation  Actions  (NAMAs),  and  the  mechanism  for  Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Rwanda supports 
the  development  of  effective  accounting  rules  under  the  UNFCCC  to  guarantee 
the environmental integrity of market mechanisms.

1.  PREAMBLE 
 
In accordance with Decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Arab Republic of Egypt hereby 
submits  its  report  on  the  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (INDCs) 
towards  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on 
Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  set  forth  in  Article  2  thereof.  The  report  provides 
information which enhances clarity, transparency, and understanding of Egypt's INDC. 
 
INDC Definition: 
 
Measures  determined  and  intended  to  be  applied  by  the  country  to  face  climate 
change  in  terms  of  adaptation  (to  climate  change  impacts)  and  mitigation  (reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions). 
 
The INDC Report includes the following elements: 
 

1.  National  circumstances  that  address  general  economic  conditions,  including 
economic and population growth rates, major sustainable development  goals, 
and political circumstances. 

2.  National  efforts  implemented  to  combat  climate  change  in  Egypt,  in  terms  of 
treating  impacts  in  different  sectors  (agriculture,  water  resources,  coastal 
zones,  etc.)  or  efforts  made  to  reduce  GHGs  emissions  in  different  sectors 
(energy, transportation, industry, etc.). 

3.  Required  implementation  mechanisms  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  plan 

(funding, capacity building, and technology transfer). 

 

Summary  of  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  are  presented  in  the 
following sections. 
 
2.  NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
 
The Egyptian environment is influenced by many national, regional, and global factors. 
National factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
2.1 Population Growth   
 
Globally, Egypt ranks 16th in terms of population estimated at 89 million (August 2015). 
Between 1990 and 2015, the population grew by 30 million inhabitants, with an annual 
growth  rate  of  2.2%,  and  a  total  increase  of  30%  compared  to  1990  census.  UN 
population prospect reports anticipate that the annual growth rate will remain over2% 
until  2040,  where  The  Egyptian  population  is  estimated  to  reach  116  million

inhabitants. 
 
As per the World Bank, the population density was estimated at 82.43 inhabitant/km2. 
In  1990,  the  population  density  was  58.1  inhabitant/km2.  Rural  population,  as  a 
percentage  of  total  population,  was  56  %,  57%  and  57%,  in  1990,  2000,  and  2010 
respectively.   
 
High  population  growth  rates  and  densities  impose  huge  pressure  on  the  economic, 
social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  
 
2.2 Economic Conditions  

*  Economic Situation during FY 2014/2015  

 
2014/2015  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  witnessed  a  significant  improvement  in  the  real  economic 
growth  rate,  which  increased  during  the  first  nine  month  of  this  year  to  reach  4.7%. 
The  growth  rate  is  expected  to  reach  4%  by  the  end  of  FY  2014/2015  with  a  major 
contribution  from  the  service  sector.  The  net  direct  foreign  investment  reached  $6.4 
billion during FY 2014/2015 compared to about $4.1 billion last year, which represents 
an 
increase  of  approximately  55%.  Moreover,  the  recent  efforts  and  reform 
simplemindedly the government were successful in improving and stabilizing the credit 
rating of Egypt. In addition, the unemployment rate has fallen in the period April-June 
2015  from  13.3%  to  12.7%  compared  with  the  same  period  during  the  two  previous 
years. The foreign debts decreased by the end of July 2015 to $47.1 billion compared 
to  $48.1  billion  in  June  2015.  Despite  the  noticeable  improvement  in  the  economic 
indicators,  the  Egyptian  economy  is  still  facing  certain  ongoing  challenges.  These 
challenges include the high inflation rate and the trade deficit caused by the decline in 
petroleum exports as a result of the falling world oil prices, along with the increase in 
the balance of payments on commodity imports.    
 

*  Planned Economic Situation during FY 2015/2016 

 

The  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan  for  FY  2015/2016  aims  at  increasing  the 
real economic growth rate to reach 5.5% and puts special emphasis on national mega 
projects. 

 

*  Planned Economic Situation up to 2030 

 
In  light  of  the  current  global  trend  towards  the  adoption  of  post-2015  sustainable 
development  goals,  Egypt  has  developed  the  "Sustainable  Development  Strategy; 
Egypt's Vision 2030" which serves as a roadmap for the country to achieve its desired 
sustainable  development  goals  during  the  next  15  years.  This  strategy  promotes  the 
optimum  use  of  available  resources,  enhancement  of  Egypt's  competitiveness  and 
revival of its historic leading role in the region. Moreover, such strategy aims at fulfilling 
the  aspirations  of  the  Egyptian  people  regarding  their  right  to  a  decent  standard  of 
living.  The  goals  outlined  in  the  strategy  are  in  line  with  the  global  sustainable 
development goals (SDGs).

2.4 Political and Social Context  
 

*  Egypt  has  witnessed  many  positive  developments  during  the  past  year  with 
regards  to  political  stability.  In  January  2014,  a  new  constitution  was  adopted 
and in May 2014 President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was elected as President of the 
Republic.  Moreover,  holding  the  parliamentary  elections  set  for  October  and 
November 2015 is the final step in the implementation of the country's political 
roadmap.  

*  Concerning social justice, the government seeks to achieve the following goals:  
o  Expand social security allocations to include self-employed farmers who 

own more than one Feddan and expand their medical insurance. 

o  Launch  a  cash  transfer  programme  and  increase  the  number  of 

beneficiaries. 

o  Establish  logistic  centers  for  grain  trade  and  storage  to  achieve  food 

security. 

o  Replace traditional ration books with smart cards, adopt a new rationing 

system and apply the new bread supply system.   

*  Upon assuming office, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi announced a wide range of 
projects  and  reform  plans.  During  Egypt  Economic  Development  Conference 
(EEDC)  that  was  held  13-15  March  2015,  the  Government  launched  its 
economic  reform  program  designed  to  restore  fiscal  stability,  drive  growth 
rates, and attract domestic and international investors in key sectors.   

*  Egypt  has  witnessed  significant  improvement  in  a  number  of  social  indicators 
over  the  past  two  decades.  However,  Egypt  still  seeks  to  increase  human 
development  rates.  Children  death  rates  and  malnutrition  cases  have  been 
reduced by 50%.In the meantime, life expectancy has risen from 64 to 71 years 
during the same period. 

 
3.  NATIONAL EFFORTS in  ADAPTATION  AND  MITIGATION 
 
3.1 Egypt's Adaptation Efforts  

 

3.1.1 Adaptation Challenges (Climate Change Risks) 
 
The vulnerability of Egypt's water resources to climate change depends on Nile flows, 
rainfall, and ground water. 
 
In  the  agricultural  sector,  climate  change  studies  expect  that  the  productivity  of  two 
major crops in Egypt - wheat and maize -will be reduced by 15% and 19%, respectively, 
by  2050.  Losses  in  crop  productivity  are  mainly  attributed  to  frequent  temperature 
increase, irrigation water deficit, and pests and plant disease. In addition, 12% to 15% 
of the most fertile arable land in Nile Delta is negatively affected by sea level rise and 
salt water intrusion.  
 
In terms of livestock production, current evidence shows that temperature rise leads to 
harmful  heat  stress,  which  negatively  impacts  livestock  productivity.  New  animal 

 

 | P a g e

diseases  have  emerged  in  Egypt,  which  have  strong  negative  impacts  on  livestock 
production.  These  include  bluetongue  disease  and  rift  valley  fever,  which  are  both 
attributed to significant changes in the Egyptian climate. 

 

is  expected  to 

Climate  change 
increase  seawater  temperature,  shifting  fish 
distributions northwards to live in deeper waters. In addition, increased water salinity 
in the coastal lakes in Egypt is expected to negatively affect fish species. 
 
Coastal zones are expected to suffer from climate change direct impacts. These include 
sea level rise and the overflow of low-level land. Estimations indicate that sea level rise 
by  50  cm  leads  to  serious  impacts  on  low-level  lands  in  Delta  and  adjacent  highly 
populated  cities  such  as  Alexandria  and  Port  Said.  Consequently,  this  will  result  in  a 
more significant challenge, which is the migration of people from the affected areas to 
other  areas,  thus  affecting  the  efficiency  of  different  services  and  increasing  the 
financial cost required for their development. 
 
As  forth  tourism  sector,  coral  reefs  which  constitute  a  major  attraction  in  Red  Sea 
resorts are highly vulnerable to climate change. In urban areas, heat islands1formed by 
hot  air  arising  from  the  increasing  use  of  energy  in  buildings  represent  the  main 
concern in hot arid climates. 
 
In addition, one of the most significant potential negative impacts of climate change is 
the harm inflicted on national heritage as result of temperature rise, sandy winds and 
ground  water.  However,  this  is  not  just  a  national  concern.  Instead,  it  is  a  global 
challenge since this heritage is part of the human heritage. 
 
In  health  sector,  climate  change  increases  direct  and  indirect  negative  impacts  on 
public  health  in  Egypt.  For  example,  in  2015  the  negative  impacts  are  represented  in 
higher death rate due to heat stress. 
 
In  the  energy  sector,  the  increase  in  temperature  negatively  affects  the  efficiency  of 
conventional  power  plants  and  photovoltaic  cells.  Moreover,  the  sea  level  rise 
threatens  the  electric  power  plants  and  networks  located  along  the  coasts.  Also,  the 
negative  impact  of  climate  change  on  rainfall  rates  and  rain  distribution  across 
different regions negatively affects power generation from hydropower plants. This, of 
course, is in addition to the increased electricity consumption rates as a result of the 
use of air conditioners. 

 

 
 
 
 

1 Heat island is a meteorological phenomenon which happens in cities. Spaces between high buildings 
from different sides traps heat, which affects weather in cities.

3.1.2 Egypt's Intended Actions to Promote Resilience 
 
a.  Water Resources  
 
Several  measures  are  currently  being  considered  to  adapt  to  decreasing  water 
resources or increasing Nile flows. These primarily include: 

Increasing water storage capacity 
Improving irrigation and draining systems 

-  Maintaining water level in Lake Nasser 
- 
- 
-  Changing cropping patterns and farm irrigation systems 
-  Reducing surface water evaporation by redesigning canal cross sections 
-  Developing new water resources through upper Nile projects 
-  Rain water harvesting 
-  Desalination 
-  Treated wastewater recycling 
- 

Increased use of deep groundwater reservoirs 
 

In  addition,  public  awareness  is  being  raised  on  the  need  for  rationalizing  water  use, 
enhancing  precipitation  measurement  networks  in  upstream  countries  of  the  Nile 
Basin,  encouraging  data  exchange  between  Nile  Basin  countries,  and  developing 
Circulation Models to predict the impact of climate change on local and regional water 
resources. 
 
b.  Agricultural Security  
 
Changing  sowing  dates  and  good  management  practices  are  among  the  important 
adaptation measures oriented to mitigate climate change. Changing cultivars to  those 
that  are  more  tolerant  to  heat,  salinity  and  pests,  and  changing  crop  pattern  are  the 
most  promising  adaptation  measures  at  the  national  level.  Moreover,  using  different 
multi-level  combinations  of  improved  surface  irrigation  systems  and  applying  deficit 
irrigation  are  successful  means  of  increasing  surface  irrigation  system  capacity  in 
traditional lands to overcome the negative impacts of climate change. 
 
Concerning  livestock,  improving  the  current  low  productivity  of  cattle  in  addition  to 
improving  feeding  programs  are  being  considered.  No  clear  adaptation  options  are 
defined for fishery wealth.  
 
There  is  a  dire  need  for  further  studies  on  the  impacts  and  adaptation  to  climate 
change  in  the  agricultural  sector  in  order  to  develop  an  adaptation  strategy,  which 
overcomes the barriers  to  implementing  adaptation measures. These barriers  include 
limited scientific information and strategic visions, and lack of financial support. 
c.  Coastal Zones  

 

 

Adaptation  options  for  coastal  zones  are  highly  site-dependent.  However,  changes  in 
land  use,  integrated  coastal zone management, and proactive  planning for  protecting 
coastal  zones  are  necessary  adaptation  policies.  Providing  job  opportunities  in  safe 
areas (in locations that are not impacted by climate change) is an important priority to 
successfully absorb affected population.

3.2 Mitigation Policies and Measures  
 
3.2.1 Mitigation Policies 
 
The key for Egypt to mitigate GHGs emissions is to provide appropriate foundations for 
the development of low carbon energy systems. 
 
Pathways to achieving high CO2 mitigation levels comprise the following:   

 
*  Widespread diffusion of locally-appropriate low-carbon energy production 

technologies, with substantial reductions in energy intensity 

*  Comprehensive mitigation efforts covering all major sources of emissions 
*  Locally-appropriate technology transfer and financial flows from industrialized 
countries (Annex I countries) to support carbon emission abatement according 
to the UNFCCC principles, which acknowledges that developed countries should 
provide required support to developing countries in this regard. 

 
Policies targeting development that is more sustainable rely upon five main pillars: 
 

1.  More efficient use of energy, especially by end users; 
2.  Increased use of renewable energy as  an alternative to non-renewable energy 

sources;  

3.  Use of advanced locally-appropriate and more-efficient fossil fuel technologies, 

which is less-emitting, in addition to new generations of nuclear power; 

4.  Energy efficiency is the cornerstone to be targeted by policy makers to decouple 

demand on energy and economic growth; and 

5.  Reform energy subsidies. This policy is implemented using four pillars, namely: 
set  different  prices  for  petroleum  products  based  on  energy  generation 
efficiency;  increase  the  efficiency  of  energy  use;  provide  support  to  certain 
sectors to promote switching from conventional energy sources to clean energy 
sources; and apply the fuel subsidy smartcard system  to ensure that subsidies 
are received by target beneficiaries. 

 
The degree to which efficiency improvements can limit energy demand growth is one 
of  the  main  distinguishing  characteristics  of  greenhouse  gas  reduction  pathways. 
Energy  efficiency  could  be  improved  radically  through  a  combination  of  behavioral 
changes  and  rapid 
introduction  of  stringent  efficiency  regulations,  technology 
standards, and environmental externality pricing, which mitigates rebound effects.  
 
Renewable energy technologies, which are relevant to the local context, will play a very 
important role in reducing GHG emissions, but they would not suffice to keep climate 
change  manageable. 
  However,  renewable  energy  may  provide  a  number  of 
opportunities since it also addresses sustainable and equitable economic development, 
energy  access,  secure  energy  supply,  and  reduced  local  environmental  and  health 
impacts.  
 

 

 | P a g e

11
 

In  addition,  efforts  in  Egypt  should  focus  on  replacing  or  upgrading  obsolete 
infrastructure  e.g.  upgrading  old  fossil  fuel  power  plants  with  locally  appropriate 
technologies to increase its capacity. This needs increase financial support from Annex 
I parties in addition to technology transfer and local capacity building. 
 
There  are  four  key  technology-related  requirements  essential  for  transformation:  (i) 
continued  support  of  energy  conversion  efficiencies,  (ii)  carbon  capture  and  storage 
"CCS" as a technology alternative that can be used in the future if proven economically 
feasible,(iii)  co-utilization  of  fossil  fuel  and  biomass  in  the  same  plants,  and  (iv) 
utilization of co-generation plants. 
  
Using  advanced  generations  of  nuclear  reactors  could  be  important  to  fill  the  gap 
between reducing fossil fuel dependence and the deployment of renewable energy. In 
addition, nuclear energy can be an important contributor in the future energy mix  to 
stabilize CO2 levels as energy demand continues to grow.  
  
Additional  mitigation  measures  include  the  increase  of  the  country's  CO2  absorptive 
capacity through plantation, maintaining suitable types of trees along  road sides, the 
middle-island of inter-city and urban roads, and on irrigation and drainage canal banks. 
In addition, wood forests should use treated wastewater for irrigation.

The  two  following  tables  present  the  most  important  mitigation  actions  across  different 
sectors at the national level.

4.  NEW MARKET MECHANISMS  

 

 

A  national  market  for  carbon  trading  may  be  established.  This  national  market  may 
further  be  developed  into  a  regional  market,  which  can  attracting  foreign  direct 
investment  in  national  carbon  credit  transactions,  especially  in  the  Arab  and  African 
region. 

5.  NEED FOR STRONG ECONOMIC APPROACH 
 
Within  this  context,  Egypt  needs  to  develop  and  implement  a  strong  economically 
feasible  mitigation  program  in  the  near  future,  which  would  achieve  the  proposed 
emission reduction for 2030 at the lowest cost to the national economy. 

Hence,  an  Egyptian  comprehensive  emission  reduction  program  should  be  based  on 
three main initiatives: 

1.  Stimulate mitigation actions through a portfolio of strong and coordinated policies 
for the efficient reduction of GHGs across industry sectors and different geographic 
areas.  

2.  Pursue energy efficiency and low-cost options through the following: 

•  Fast  development  of  the  infrastructure  required  for 

low-carbon  energy 

systems; and 

 

 | P a g e

12
 

•  Encouraging  research  and  development  in  promising  technologies,  which  are 

suitable for the local context and stimulate their deployment.  

3. Develop a national monitoring, reporting, and verification system. 

The  initial  total  estimated  cost  of  implementing  adaptation  measures  aiming  at 
mitigating the negative impacts of climate change and the national endeavors aiming 
at  contributing  to  the  efforts  made  by  the  international  community  to  reduce  GHG 
emissions  during  the  period  2020-2030  is  estimated  at  USD  73  billion.  This  figure  is 
adapted to inflation rates and change in currency exchange rate for this period. 

 
6.  MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION 

 

Implementation  of  INDCs  requires  sustainable  international  support  from  reliable 
resources  through  financial  flows,  capacity  building,  and  technology  transfer  as 
relevant to the local context. 
 
Preliminary  estimates  of  the  financial  contributions  required  for  implementing  the 
INDCs  for  both  adaptation  and  mitigations  estimated  at  approximately73.04  billion 
USD  can  be  increased.  In  addition,  transfer  of  technology  appropriate  to  the  local 
context  and  national  capacity  building  are  needed.  Thus,  Article  4  of  the  UNFCCC, 
which  states  that  developed  parties  shall  provide  support  to  developing  countries  in 
applying their liabilities, should be enacted. Hence, Egyptian national efforts alone will 
not be able to fulfill the State aspirations in contributing to the international climate 
change abatement efforts. Depending only on local financial resources, along with the 
large development aspirations of Egypt, will limit this contribution.

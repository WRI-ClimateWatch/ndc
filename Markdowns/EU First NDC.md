SUBMISSION  BY  LATVIA  AND  THE  EUROPEAN  COMMISSION  ON 
BEHALF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES  

Riga, 6 March 2015 

 

Subject: 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the EU and its 
Member States 

 
Introduction  
 

1.  The EU and its 28 Member States are fully committed to the UNFCCC 
negotiating process with a view to adopting a global legally binding 
agreement applicable to all Parties at the Paris Conference in December 
2015 in line with the below 2°C objective. 

 

Intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) of the EU and its 
Member States  

 
2.  The Lima Conference confirmed the Warsaw decision that all Parties ready 

to do so should communicate their INDC in the first quarter of 2015 in a 
manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the 
INDC. 

 
3.  The EU and its Member States wish to communicate the following INDC. 

The EU and its Member States are committed to a binding target of an at 
least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 
compared to 1990, to be fulfilled jointly, as set out in the conclusions by 
the European Council of October 2014. In line with the Lima Call for 
Climate Action, in particular its paragraph 14, the following quantifiable 
information is hereby submitted: 

 
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the EU and its Member 
States 
Parties 

ANNEX 

EU and its Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, 
Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Austria, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, 
Sweden, United Kingdom) acting jointly 
Absolute reduction from base year emissions. 
Economy-wide absolute reduction from base year 
emissions.  
All greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal 
Protocol: Carbon Dioxide (CO2) 

•  Methane (CH4) 
•  Nitrous Oxide (N2O) 
•  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
•  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)

1990. 
1 January 2021- 31 December 2030.  
At least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030. 
100%. 

Policy on how to include Land Use, Land Use Change and 
Forestry into the 2030 greenhouse gas mitigation 
framework will be established as soon as technical 
conditions allow and in any case before 2020.  
No contribution from international credits.

Planning Process 

Domestic legally-binding legislation already in place for 
the 2020 climate and energy package. The existing 
legislation for land use, land-use change and forestry (EU 
Decision 529/2013) is based on the existing accounting 
rules under the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol. Legislative proposals to implement the 2030 
climate and energy framework, both in the emissions 
trading sector and in the non-traded sector, to be 
submitted by the European Commission to the Council 
and European Parliament in 2015-2016 on the basis of 
the general political directions by the European Council, 
taking into account environmental integrity.  

Fair and ambitious  The target represents a significant progression beyond its 

current undertaking of a 20% emission reduction 
commitment by 2020 compared to 1990 (which includes 
the use of offsets).  It is in line with the EU objective, in the 
context of necessary reductions according to the IPCC by 
developed countries as a group, to reduce its emissions by 
80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990. Furthermore, it is 
consistent with the need for at least halving global 
emissions by 2050 compared to 1990. The EU and its 
Member States have already reduced their emissions by 
around 19% on 1990 levels while GDP has grown by more 
than 44% over the same period. As a result, average per 
capita emissions across the EU and its Member States 
have fallen from 12 tonnes CO2-eq. in 1990 to 9 tonnes 
CO2-eq. in 2012 and are projected to fall to around 6 
tonnes CO2-eq. in 2030. The emissions in the EU and its 
Member States peaked in 1979.

Follow up 

 
4.  The EU and its Member States urge all other Parties, in particular major 

economies, to communicate their INDCs by the end of March 2015 in a 

manner that facilitates their clarity, transparency and understanding. 

 
5.  The EU and its Member States request the UNFCCC Secretariat to publish 

the INDC of the EU and its Member States on its website and to take it into 

account when preparing the synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the 

INDCs communicated by Parties. 

 

 
 

 

6.  The EU and its Member States look forward to discussing with other 

Parties the fairness and ambition of INDCs in the context of the below 2°C 

objective, their aggregate contribution to that objective and on ways to 

collectively increase ambition further.

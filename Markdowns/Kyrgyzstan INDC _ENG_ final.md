The Kyrgyz Republic  

 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

 
Climate change is the greatest challenge and the most  universal objective for the humanity. This 
global problem requires the immediate consistent actions by the world community. 
 
The  Kyrgyz  Republic  belongs  to  the  furthermost  vulnerable  countries  to  climate  change, 
understands the importance of addressing the challenge and is making every effort to ensure that 
these  initiatives  are  successful.  Actions  on  climate  change  are  reflected  in  the  "National 
Sustainable  Development  Strategy  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  2013-2017"  and  the  "Program  of 
the Kyrgyz Republic on Transition to Sustainable Development for 2013-2017." 
 
The Climate Change Coordination Commission (CCCC), headed by the First Vice Prime Minister 
of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  coordinates  all  the  activities  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  related  to  climate 
change. The CCCC is composed of all heads of key ministries and divisions, representatives of the 
civil, academic and business sectors. 
 
Actions  for  adaptation  to  climate  change  are  developed  and  included  in  the  "Priorities  for 
Adaptation  to  Climate  Change  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  till  2017".  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has 
developed the sectorial plans and programs for adaptation in all vulnerable sectors. 

The  Kyrgyz  Republic's  greenhouse  gases  (GHG)  emissions  are  relatively  low.  In  2010,  the 
contribution  of  the  country  to  the  total  global  GHG  emissions  from  fossil  fuel  combustion  was 
0.023%,  while  the  population  was  0.079%  of  the  world's  total  population,  i.e.  per  capita  GHG 
emission in the Kyrgyz Republic is less than one-third of the world average. However, the planned 
economic  development  will  lead  to  a  sharp  increase  in  greenhouse  gases  emissions,  which 
determines the need for resolute actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

The  intended  nationally  determined  contribution  is  prepared  in  accordance  with  decisions  of  the 
Conference of the Parties to  the UN Framework  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 1 / 
CP.19 and 1 / CP.20.

3. Contribution 

Limiting the per capita GHG emissions to maximum of 1.23 t/CO2, or 1.58 
t/CO2  in  2050  to  achieve  the  below  2°C  objective,  with  a  probability  of 
66% and 50% respectively. 
Based on the IPCC and IEA developments in the context of the below 2°C 
objective,  the  target  is  communicated  in  CO2.  For  INDC  monitoring, 
emission of other GHGs was accounted in CO2-eq (shown in Section 12). 
January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2030,  and 2050  
Kyrgyz  Republic  will  reduce  GHG  emissions  in  the  range  of  11.49  -
13.75% below BAU in 2030. Additionally, under the international support 
Kyrgyz Republic could implement the mitigation measures to achieve total 
reduction in the range of 29.00 - 30.89% below BAU in 2030.  
 
Kyrgyz Republic will reduce GHG emissions in the range of 12.67 -
15.69% below BAU in 2050. Additionally, under the international support 
Kyrgyz Republic could implement the mitigation measures to achieve total 
reduction in the range of 35.06 - 36.75% below BAU in 2050.

To  assess  the  potential  mitigation  actions  to  achieve  the  long  term  GHG 
emissions target, the following scenarios were developed:  
*  Scenario 1: Low population growth - high economic growth; 
*  Scenario 2: Average population growth - average economic growth; 
*  Scenario 3: High population growth - low economic growth. 
The  following  estimates  of  population  for  2050  (in 
Scenario 1 - 6872; Scenario 2 - 7975; Scenario 3 - 9170. 
Figure  below  provides  a  graphical  illustration  of  per  capita  emissions  for

contribution  will  be  combined  with  a  process  of  regular 
updating of the national mitigation priorities, programs and 
action plans. Preparation of the updated programs and plans 
will  be  based  on  assessments  of  the  earlier  mitigation 
measures' implementation.  
The  domestic  MRV  system  will  be  developed  and 
established  as  a  basis  for  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the 
mitigation actions. 
Reporting  will  also  be  carried  out  in  the  frames  of  the 
national  communications  on  climate  change  and  biennial

the  hydropower 

GHG emissions of the Kyrgyz Republic are small. In 2010, 
the  share  of  the  Republic  in  global  GHG  emissions  from 
fossil  fuel  combustion  was  0.023%.  Per  capita  GHG 
emissions of the Kyrgyz Republic are less than one-third of 
the world average. 
The low  emissions of Kyrgyz Republic are  largely  because 
90%  of  the  total  electricity  generation  is  supplied  by  the 
hydroelectric power plants.  However, the expected climate 
change  impacts  will  decrease  the  water  flow  after  the  30s 
and,  consequently, 
resources 
potential.  As  a  result,  even  with  an  annual  GDP  growth  of 
4%, the electricity demand for Kyrgyzstan's economy would 
be  much  more  that  can  be  met  through  the  hydropower 
capacities. 
The Kyrgyz Republic is a lower middle income country with 
637.3  pc  income,  compared  to  global  average  per  capita 
income  of  8054.6  (2014,  $2005).  To  meet  its  development 
needs  the  economy  is  expected  to  grow  and  so  will  do  the 
GHG emissions. The increase in GHG emissions is expected 
to be much faster than in the developed countries.  
Despite this, the long term vision of the Kyrgyz Republic is 
to limit the per capita GHG emissions to a very low level of 
1.58  t  CO2  in  line  with  20C  objective.  Hence,  the  ambition 
and fairness  of the national  efforts,  submitted in the  INDC, 
is evident and equitable in the face of a sharp growth of the 
country's economic level.

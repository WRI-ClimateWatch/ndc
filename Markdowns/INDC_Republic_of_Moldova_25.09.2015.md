Republic of Moldova's Intended National Determined Contribution 

 

 

1. Introduction 

The Republic of Moldova is fully committed to the UNFCCC negotiation process towards adopting 
at COP21 a protocol, another legal  instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the 
Convention, applicable to all Parties, in line with keeping global warming below 2oC. 

The Republic of Moldova hereby communicates its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
(INDC)  and  the  accompanying  information  to  facilitate  clarity,  transparency,  and  understanding, 
with reference to decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20. 

Regarding the invitation to consider undertakings in adaptation planning, the Republic of Moldova 
has  included  in  Annex  1  to  INDC  the  information  on  adaptation  contained  in  its  draft  Fourth 
National  Communication  currently  under  preparation,  as  well  as  in  the  Republic  of  Moldova‘s 
Climate  Change  Adaptation  Strategy  covering  the  period  up  to  2020  and  the  Action  Plan  on  its 
implementation, approved recently by Governmental Decision No. 1009 as of 10.12.2014. 

 

2. Republic of Moldova's Intended National Determined Contribution 

The Republic of Moldova intends to achieve an economy-wide unconditional target of reducing its 
greenhouse gas emissions by 64-67 per cent below its 1990 level in 2030 and to make best efforts 
to reduce its emissions by 67 per cent.  

The  reduction  commitment  expressed  above  could  be  increased  up  to  78  per  cent  below  1990 
level  conditional  to,  a  global  agreement  addressing  important  topics  including  low-cost  financial 
resources,  technology  transfer,  and  technical  cooperation,  accessible  to  all  at  a  scale 
commensurate to the challenge of global climate change. 

In line with Lima Call for Climate Action, in particular its paragraph 14, the following quantifiable 
information is hereby submitted:

Intended National Determined Contribution  

Quantifiable 
information on 
the reference 
period  

Timeframes and 
periods of 
implementation 

Base Year: 1990.  
Total Emissions in Base Year: 43.4 Mt CO2 eq (without LULUCF) and 37.5 Mt 
CO2  eq  (with  LULUCF).  These  data  are  provisional  and  will  be  defined  on 
biennial basis through inventory submissions.  
Time  frame  of  the  commitment  is  from  1st  January  2021  to  31st  December 
2030.  Its  achievement  will  be  tracked  periodically  through  the  Republic  of 
Moldova's Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. 

Absolute reduction from base year emissions. 

Economy-wide absolute reduction from the base year emissions.  
The geographic coverage is the same as the  country's geopolitical boundary 
(including  the  administrative  territorial  units  on  the  left  bank  of  Dniester 
river).  
Republic  of  Moldova  intends  to  account  for  100  percent  of  national 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the base year as published in the 
Republic  of  Moldova's  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  and  Sinks,  on  a  net-net 
basis.   

(CO2),  Methane 

Gases Covered: all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol 
-  Carbone  Dioxide 
(N2O), 
Hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs),  Perfluorocarbons  (PFCs),  Sulphur  hexafluoride 
(SF6), Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). 
Sectors  covered:  energy;  industrial  processes  and  product  use;  agriculture; 
land use, land-use change and forestry; and waste.  

(CH4),  Nitrous  oxide 

The Republic of Moldova is committed to an unconditional target of a 64-67 
per  cent  reduction  of  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2030  compared  to 
1990  levels.  The  64  per  cent  reduction  corresponds  to  a  self-sufficiency 
power system development scenario, while the 67 per cent reduction allows 
for a 30 per cent import of electricity.  
The reduction commitment could increase up to 78 per cent reduction below 
1990  level  conditional  to  a  global  agreement  addressing  important  topics, 
including  access  to  low-cost  financial  resources,  technology  transfer  and 
technical  cooperation  commensurate  to  the  challenge  of  global  climate 
change. 

Relevant  legislative  acts  for  the  INDC  implementation  are  required  and  will 
be considered being approved on Parliamentary level. 
By  mid-2016,  a  draft  Low  Emission  Development  Strategy  (LEDS)  of  the 
Republic of Moldova for the period up to 2030 will be developed.  
After  consultations  at  the  national  level,  the  Low  Emission  Development 
Strategy of the Republic of Moldova until 2030 will be subject to approval by 
the Government by end of 2016. 
The LEDS is expected to be fully in line with the provisions of the European 
Union and the Republic of Moldova Association Agreement signed on 27th of 
June 2014 and any other relevant national legislation.

Intended National Determined Contribution  

Fair and 
ambitious 

The Republic of Moldova's approach to considering fairness and ambition is 
to assess how  its INDC contributes to meeting the ultimate objective of the 
Convention,  of  achieving  stabilization  of  greenhouse  gas  concentrations  in 
the  atmosphere  at  a  level  that  would  prevent  dangerous  anthropogenic 
interference with the climate system. 
National  commitments  are  well  in  line  with  the  emissions  pathways  towards 
2050 that correspond to keeping global warming below 2oC compared to pre-
industrial levels.  
It  is  worthwhile  to  note  that  fairness  considerations 
in  the  national 
perspectives  include  various  aspects  and  no  single  indicator  on  its  own  can 
accurately  reflect  fairness  or  a  globally  equitable  distribution  of  countries' 
efforts.  
It  is  further  important  to  note  that  the  evolving  nature  of  a  country's 
circumstances is to be reflected in the fairness consideration: 
*  Responsibility 

in  a  country's  past,  current  and  future 
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Total  emissions,  as  well  as  per  capita 
emissions, are to be considered. 
The  Republic  of  Moldova's  responsibility  in  terms  of  greenhouse  gas 
emissions is low. In 2013, the Republic of Moldova emitted 12.8 Mt CO2 
eq (without LULUCF) and 12.7 Mt CO2 eq (with LULUCF), which is less than 
0.03 per cent of current world's emissions.  
Total  and  net  per  capita  emissions  were  less  than  half  of  the  world's 
average (3.2 tCO2 eq/capita vs 6.4 tCO2 eq/capita (reference), respectively 
3.1 tCO2 eq/capita vs 6.8 tCO2 eq/capita respectively)1. 
Also,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  has  a  low  level  of  historic  emissions,  of 
about 0.05 per cent (without LULUCF) and/or of about 0.04 per cent (with 
LULUCF), since 1990. 

is  reflected 

*  The  capacity  to  contribute  to  solving  the  climate  change  problem  is 
closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures. 
Hence, one aspect of capacity is to take into account the GDP growth level 
and GDP per capita in fairness considerations. 
In this context, it is worth  mentioning that within 1990-2014 period, the 
Real  GDP  decreased  in  the  Republic  of  Moldova  by  29  per  cent,  from 
9.8935  to  6.9881  billion  2010  US$,  while  the  real  GDP  per  capita 
decreased by 14 per cent, from 2,261.9 to 1,950.2 2010 US$2. 

*  The  mitigation  potential  and  abatement  costs  are  other  core  aspects  in 

considering a fair contribution of a country.  
The greenhouse gas intensity ("CO2 emissions per GDP") indices decreased 
considerably within 1990-2013 period in the Republic of Moldova, from 4.4 
to 1.9 kg CO2 per real GDP 2010 US$ (without LULUCF), or by 56.4 per cent; 
and, from 3.8 to 1.9 kg  CO2  per real  GDP 2010 US$ (with LULUCF), or by 
56.8 per cent respectively. 
These values are still among the highest within the transition economies

Key 
assumptions 
and 
methodological 
approaches 

from  the  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  and  reveal  a  high  mitigation 
potential to  achieve  the  Republic  of  Moldova's  reduction  targets.  But,  in 
order to reach the conditional target of up to 78 per cent reduction of its 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, appropriate 
international financial support approximately equal to US$ 4.9-5.1 billion, 
i.e. about US$ 327-340 million per year until 2030, is needed; the support 
needed  will  be  in  addition  to  the  domestic  allocations  to  cover  the 
required abatement costs.  
This  support  will  allow  adjusting  the  development  pathway  of  the 
Republic  of  Moldova  towards  a  low-carbon  economy,  thus  moving 
towards  progressive  decoupling  of  carbon  emissions  from  economic 
growth and ensuring a decent level of Real GDP per capita, equal to 4,483 
US$/capita  in  2030,  which  will  still be approximately  one-tenth  of  EU 28 
average, forecasted to be US$ 43,516/capita3 in 2030.  
As  stated  above,  along  with  the  international  financial  support  for 
covering  the  abatement  costs,  the  country  will  also  need  assistance  in 
form of technology transfer and capacity building. 

Metrics  applied:  The  Republic  of  Moldova  intends  to  use  100-year  Global 
Warming  Potential  (GWP)  values  to  calculate  CO2  equivalent  totals.  The 
Republic  of  Moldova  intends  to  report  emission  totals  using  the  Fourth 
Assessment  Report  values,  and  will  consider  future  updates  to  GWP  values 
from IPCC. 
Methodologies for estimating emissions: IPCC Guidelines 2006. 
Approach  to  accounting  for  agriculture,  forestry  and  other  land  use:  the 
Republic of Moldova intends to include all categories of emissions by sources 
and  removals  by  sinks,  and  all  pools  and  gases,  as  reported  in  the  National 
Inventory  of  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  and  Sinks;  to  account  for  the  land 
sector  using  a  net-net  approach;  and  to  use  a  "production  approach"  to 
account for harvested wood products which is consistent with IPCC guidance. 
The  Republic  of  Moldova  may  also  exclude  emissions  from  natural 
disturbances, as consistent with available IPCC guidance. 
There are material data collection and methodological challenges to estimate 
emissions  and  removals  in  the  land  sector.  In  compliance  with  IPCC  Good 
Practice,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  will  continue  to  improve  its  land  sector 
greenhouse gas reporting, which will involve the update of its methodologies. 
Contribution  of  international  mechanisms:  The  Republic  of  Moldova  may 
use  bilateral,  regional  and  international  market  mechanisms  to  achieve  its 
conditional  2030  target,  subject  to  robust  systems  that  deliver  real  and 
verified  emissions  reductions.  The  unconditional  INDC  commitment  will  be 
met  through  domestic  actions,  although  these  would  assist  cost-effective 
implementation.  
In  order  to  avoid  GHG  emissions'  double  counting,  an  appropriate  robust 
national MRV system will be put in place in  the period of  2016-2017. It will 
cover  the  GHG  emissions  accounting  from  international  bunkers  and  CDM 
projects as well, delivering real and verified emission reductions.

B) CLARIFYING INFORMATION ON MITIGATION ASPECTS IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA 

The Republic of Moldova's share in global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 0.03 per cent. In 
2013, total and net greenhouse gas emissions of the Republic of Moldova equalled 12.8 Mt CO2 eq 
(with  LULUCF)  and  12.7  Mt  CO2  eq  (without  LULUCF)  (see  table  1)  and  total  and  net  per  capita 
emissions were less than half of the world average (3.2 tCO2 eq/capita vs 6.4 tCO2 eq/capita, and 
3.1 tCO2 eq/capita vs 6.8 tCO2 eq/capita respectively).

In  2013,  about  65.5  per  cent  of  the  total  national  direct  GHG  emissions  originated  from  Energy 
Sector. Other relevant direct GHG sources were represented by Agriculture Sector (16.6 per cent 
of the total), Waste Sector (12.2 per cent of the total) and Industrial Processes Sector (5.2 per cent 
of the total). The share of two other sectors (Solvents and Other Product Use and Land Use, Land-
Use Change and Forestry Sector) was insignificant, less than 1.0 per cent (see figure 1).

Figure 1: Breakdown of the Republic of Moldova's Total GHG Emissions by Sectors in 2013 

In comparison with the 1990 year level, by 2013 the Republic of Moldova's GHG emissions were 
70.4 per cent below 1990 levels (see figure 2).  

From  table  2,  it  is  obvious  that  this  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  over  the  last  24  years  is  in  full 
consistency  with  a  decrease  in  some  important  socio-economic  indicators:  population  number 
decreased by 6.8 per cent, the GDP - by 32.2 per cent, the GHG intensity (CO2eq/GDP) - by 56.4 
per cent, the electricity consumption - by 52.3 per cent, the heat consumption - by 82.4 per cent, 
while the consumption of primary energy resources decreased by 78.3 per cent.

The significant reduction in the level of socio-economic indicators over the 1990-2013 periods is a 
consequence of the deep transformation processes common during transition from a centralized 
economy  to  a  market  economy,  specifically  after  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the 
declaration of the Republic of Moldova's independence on 27th of August 1991.

The country rated among the  low-medium income countries in 1990, and  it is at present one of 
the lowest income nations in Europe. Certain economic decline patterns had been registered prior 
to 1991, but the separation from the USSR has considerably accelerated the process.  

The GDP level was decreasing continuously during the period from 1990 to 1999 inclusively, when 
it fell down to as little as 34 per cent of the 1990 level. The reasons for the economic collapse were 
numerous.  First,  the  country  had  been  fully  integrated  in  the  USSR  economic  system,  and  the 
independence  resulted,  among  other  things,  in  the  cessation  of  any  subsidies  or  cash  transfers 
from  the  centralized  government.  Second,  the  end  of  the  Soviet  Era  with  its  well  established 
commercial  links  has  resulted  in  the  emergence  of  numerous  obstacles  for  free  movement  of 
goods, and in access restrictions introduced by the emerging markets. Third, the lack of domestic 
energy  resources  and  raw  materials  in  the  country  has  contributed  considerably  to  the  nation's 
strong dependence on other former Soviet Republics.  

This dependence has affected consumers' capacity to pay for the energy used due to the increased 
prices  of  energy  resources  (ex.,  from  1997  to  2014  the  natural  gas  tariff  increased  13.0  times; 
electricity  tariff  increased  6.6  times;  gasoline,  diesel  and  liquefied  gases  prices  increased  1.9 
times), in the condition when about 95% of energy resources were imported. On the other hand, 
without  applying  cross  subsidizations  policies,  the  current  energy  prices  have  incentivized  the 
population to take strong energy efficiency measures in the Republic of Moldova, which led to a 
significant decrease of the energy intensity, declining since 2006 with an average annual negative 
growth of 11.3 per cent. 

At the same time, within 2000-2013 period, the real GDP increased by 90.5 per cent, from 3.5229 
to 6.7119 billion 2010 US$, while the real GDP per capita increased by 120.0 per cent, from 842.8 
to  1,854.1  2010  US$.  The  considerable  real  GDP  growth  achieved  since  2000  seems  to  indicate 
that the economy is finally developing in the correct direction, although it should be remembered 
that in 2013 the real GDP reached only 68 per cent of the 1990 year level. It is worth mentioning 
that from 2000 to 2013, the electricity consumption increased in the Republic of Moldova by 20.8 
per cent; the heat consumption - by 10.0 per cent, the consumption of primary energy resources - 
by 16.8 per cent; while the GHG intensity (CO2eq/GDP) decreased during the same period by 37.2 
per  cent,  showing  the  first  signs  of  the  decoupling  of  economic  growth  from  the  growth  in 
greenhouse gas emissions, by 19.6 per cent within 2000-2013 periods (see figure 3).

Pre-2020 Mitigation Policy Framework 

In  2010,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  joined  the  Copenhagen  Accord  and  submitted  an  emission 
reduction  target  to  the  UNFCCC  Secretariat,  which  is  specified  in  Annex  II  to  this  Agreement 
"Nationally  Appropriate  Mitigation  Actions  of  the  Developing  Countries".  The  target  of  the 
appropriate  mitigation  actions  of  the  Republic  of  Moldova  envisaged  in  this  Agreement 
represents:  

"A  reduction  of  no  less  than  25%  of  the  1990  level  total  national  GHG  emissions  has  to  be 
achieved  by  2020  through  implementation  of  global  economic  mechanisms  focused  on  the 
climate change mitigation, in accordance with the Convention's principles and provisions."  

This target was provided without specific nationally appropriate mitigation actions, identified and 
quantified,  or  further  clarification  on  the  support  needed.  However,  it  was  recognized  that,  to 
achieve  this  target,  significant  financial,  technological  and  capacity  building  support  will  be 
needed, which can be provided by UNFCCC mechanisms. 

The  Environmental  Protection  Strategy  for  the  years  2014-2023  and  the  Action  Plan  for  its 
implementation  was  recently  approved  through  the  Governmental  Decision  No.  301  as  of 
24.04.20144. According to this policy document, a 20 per cent GHG emissions reduction compared 
to the BAU scenario has to be reached in the Republic of Moldova by 2020.  

Along  with  the  overall  national  target,  the  policy  document  sets  up  GHG  emissions  reduction 
targets for seven economic sectors:  

*  power  production  sector  -  25  per  cent  GHG  emissions  reduction  compared  to  BAU 

scenario has to be achieved by 2020;  

*  buildings,  industry  and  agriculture  sectors  -  20  per  cent  GHG  emissions  reduction 

* 

compared to BAU scenario has to be reached by 2020;  
transport  and  waste  sectors  -  15  per  cent  GHG  emissions  reduction  compared  to  BAU 
scenario has to be achieved by 2020; and  

*  LULUCF sector - an increase by 25 per cent of the net removals has to be reached by 2020.  

The  desired  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  by  2020  of  20  per  cent  below  the  BAU  scenario  level 
requires decisive actions at the national and sector levels. For instance, considerable  abatement 
contributions  are  expected  to  be  achieved  within  the  energy  sector  (533  ktep  savings  are 
envisaged  from  energy  efficiency  measures  and  430  ktep  savings  from  RES  implementation 
covering the energy demand - the policy instruments in place envisage increasing the share of RES 
in the country's energy balance up to 20 percent by 2020, and covering up to 10 percent of the 
electricity demand with locally produced renewable energy by 2020). 

Post-2020 Mitigation Policies Framework 

Relevant  legislative  acts  for  the  INDC's  commitments  implementation  within  2021-2030  periods 
are required and will be considered being approved on Parliamentary level. 

By mid-2016,  a draft  Low  Emission Development  Strategy  (LEDS)  of the Republic  of  Moldova  for 
the  period  up  to  2030  will  be  developed.  After  consultations  at  the  national  level,  the  Low 
Emission Development Strategy of the Republic of Moldova until 2030 will be subject to approval 
by the Government by end of 2016. 

Thus,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  stays  committed  to  and  striving  for  an  ambitious  international 
agreement on climate change in line with recommendations by science to maintain average global 
temperature increase below two degrees Celsius.

3. FOLLOW UP 

The Republic of Moldova urges all other Parties, in particular major economies, to communicate 
their INDCs in a manner that facilitates their clarity, transparency and understanding. 

The Republic of Moldova requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to publish its INDC on its website and to 
take  it  into  account  when  preparing  the  synthesis  report  on  the  aggregate  effect  of  the  INDCs 
communicated by Parties. 

The Republic of Moldova looks forward to discussing with other Parties the fairness and ambition 
of  the  INDCs  in  the  context  of  the  below  2oC  objective,  their  aggregate  contribution  to  that 
objective and ways to collectively further increase this ambition.

A) UP-FRONT INFORMATION ON ADAPTATION PLANNING 

A.I. Climate change trends, impacts and vulnerabilities 

The Republic of Moldova is a highly vulnerable country to the adverse impacts of climate change. 
Over  the  last  127  years,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  has  experienced  changes  in  temperature  and 
mean  precipitation.  The  country  has  become  warmer,  with  the  average  temperature  increase 
greater than 1.0°C.

the meteorological station Chisinau, central part of the country 

At  the  same  time,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  has  experienced  an  increased  number  of  extreme 
weather  events,  such  as  droughts  and  floods.  An  analysis  of  national  climate  data  revealed  that 
the frequency of droughts in the Republic of Moldova in a 10-year time span is 1-2 droughts in the 
Northern part of the country; 2-3 droughts in the Central part and 5-6 droughts in the South. Their 
frequency is increasing, especially over the last decades. During the 1990-2014 timespan, 10 years 
were  marked  by  droughts,  which  reduced  significantly  the  crop  yields.  In  1990,  1992  and  2003, 
droughts  continued  during  the  entire  vegetation  period  (April-September).  The  disastrous 
droughts  of  2007  and  2012  affected  over  70  per  cent  of  the  territory  of  the  country,  being  the 
most severe droughts in the entire instrumental record period.

Floods  also  affect  the  Republic  of  Moldova  on  a  recurring  basis.  In  the  past  70  years,  10  major 
floods on the great rivers of the Republic of Moldova (Dniester and Prut) were reported, and three 
of those occurred already in XXI century (2006, 2008 and 2010). Large floods on the smaller rivers 
of the country are also quite common. 

The  socio-economic  costs  of  climate  change  related  to  natural  disasters  such  as  droughts  and 
floods  are  significant.  Both  their  intensity  and  frequency  are  expected  to  further  increase  as  a 
result of climate change. During 1984-2006, the Republic of Moldova's average annual economic 
losses due to natural disasters were about US$61 million.  

The  2007  and  2012  droughts  alone  caused  losses  estimated  at  about  US$  1.0  and  0.4  billion, 
respectively.  The  2008  floods  cost  the  country  about  US$120  million,  and  the  total  damage  and 
losses produced by 2010 floods were estimated at approximately US$42 million. 

The patterns of future temperature and precipitation conditions were computed for the Republic 
of  Moldova  from  the  global  climate  model  output  gathered  as  part  of  the  Coupled  Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).  

Twenty one global coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models (GCMs) were implied in 
this exercise under the Forth National Communication Project, the projections being made under 
the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 available 
in the IPCC AR5.  

The  future  climatic  changes  were  assessed  over  the  three  Agro-Ecological  Zones  (AEZs)  (North, 
Centre  and  South)  of  the  Republic  of  Moldova  for  the  near  term  (2016-2035),  midterm  (2046-
2065) and long term (2081-2100) given relative to the reference period (1986-2005).  

It was revealed that for temperature, the ensemble average changes consistently have the same 
sign across scenarios and their magnitude increase from the low RCP 2.6 radiative forcing pathway 
to the high RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, as moving into the later decades of the 21st century. The CMIP5 
projections  reveal  warming  in  all  seasons  for  the  three  AEZs,  while  precipitation  projections  are 
more variable across scenarios, sub-regions and seasons.  

Annual changes for temperatures are very homogeneous over the three AEZs. The rate of warming 
is higher under RCP 8.5 scenario +4.6°C; medium +2.4°C under RCP 4.5; and smaller +1.3°C under 
the RCP 2.6 scenario by 2100. The ensemble, driven by RCP 8.5 emission scenario, estimates that 
the three AEZs will experience the most significant warming during summer from +5.9°C in North 
up to +6.1°C in South by 2100. The pattern of change derived from the ensemble RCP 2.6 models is 
quite similar, but the magnitude of change is lower from +1.3 to +1.5°C. The warming would be 
higher during winter up to +4.6°C in North, in the Centre and South temperature rise will be lower 
up to +4.2oC according to the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 2.6 scenario reveals less intense warming 
over the three AEZs, from +1.2 to +1.4°C.  

The  ensemble  projections  from  the  RCP  8.5  forcing  scenario  show  that  the  three  AEZs  would 
exhibit a general annual decrease in precipitation varying from 9.9% in North to 13.4%  in South. 
Controversially,  according  to  RCP  2.6  scenario  moderate  increase  in  precipitation  from  3.1%  in 
North  to  5.1%  in  South  by  2100  is  projected.  Winters  were  been  estimated  to  be  wetter  in  the 
Republic of Moldova by the end of the 21st century. The ensemble projections show the largest 
increase in precipitation from 4.0% (RCP 2.6) to 11.8% (RCP 8.5) in winter over Northern and the 
lowest  one  from  3.0%  (RCP  2.6)  to  7.4%  (RCP  8.5)  in  Central  parts  of  the  country  by  2100.  The 
precipitation  decrease  will  be  more  extended  in  the  three  AEZs  during  summer;  the  greatest 
rainfall reduction from 13.2% (RCP 4.5) to 25.1% (RCP 8.5) is projected in  Centre and the lowest 
one from 7.4% (RCP 4.5) to 18.1% (RCP 8.5) in the North of the Republic of Moldova.

A.II. Mid-term adaptation vision, goal and targets 

The Republic of Moldova's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy until 2020 and the Action Plan on 
its implementation have been recently approved through the Governmental Decision No. 1009 as 
of 10.12.20145.  
The  vision  of  the  Strategy  is  to  develop  and  apply  "a  mechanism  for  adaptation  to  actual  and 
potential  climate  change  impacts,  integrated  and  implemented  across  all  sectors  of  the  national 
economy so as to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to the effects of these changes".  

The  goal  of  the  Strategy  is  ‘to  assure  that  the  Republic  of  Moldova's  social  and  economic 
development is less vulnerable to climate change impacts by becoming more resilient'.  

The general objective of the Strategy is oriented towards ‘increasing the capacity of the Republic 
of Moldova to adapt and respond to actual or potential climate change effects'. 

The three specific objectives of the Strategy are to: 

1)  Create by 2018 the institutional framework in the field of climate change that would assure 

the efficient implementation of adaptation measures at the national, sector and local levels.  

2)  Create  by  2020  a  mechanism  to  monitor  the  climate  change  impacts, the  related  social  and 
economic  vulnerability  and  for  the  management/dissemination  of  the  information  on  risks 
and climate disasters.  

3)  Assure the development of climate resilience by reducing at least by 50% the climate change 
vulnerability and facilitate climate change adaptation in six priority sectors (agriculture, water 
resources, forestry, human health, energy and transport) by 2020.  

The  Action  Plan  on  implementation  of  the  Republic  of  Moldova's  Climate  Change  Adaptation 
Strategy  until  2020  is  treated  as  1st  National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP).  It  is  envisaged  that  the 
progress made in the area of adaptation to climate change will be determined on a periodic basis 
and in post-2020 period 4-year based NAPs and Sector Adaptation Plans (SAPs) will be developed 
and implemented. More detailed information on this issue is provided in section ‘A.VI. Monitoring 
and reporting progress'. 

A.III. Current and planned adaptation undertakings 

The Republic of Moldova's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy until 2020 and the Action Plan on 
its  implementation  is  intended  to  serve  as  an  umbrella  strategy  that  creates  the  enabling 
environment  for  specific  sectors  and  ministries  to  "mainstream"  climate  change  adaptation  and 
risk  management  in  their  existing  and  future  strategies  through  a  series  of  NAPs  and  SAPs, 
supported  by  a  long-term  financial  strategy  that  includes  national  resources  and  international 
support to prevent the adverse effects of climate change and maximize the opportunities provided 
by them. 

Specific Objective 1: Create by 2018 the institutional framework in the field of climate change that 
would assure the efficient implementation of adaptation measures at the national, sector and local 
levels 

The specific objective 1 is envisaged be achieved through the following courses of action: 

Action 1.1: Develop the institutional framework in the field of climate change adaptation  

The  Government  has  to  create  a  strong  institutional  structure  and  the  environment  that  would 
enable  advocating  for  climate  change  adaptation  across  all  sectors  and  at  all  levels  of 
implementation  with  strengthening  technical  capacities  and  leadership  for  implementation  of 
climate  change  adaptation  measures.  Institutional  framework  for  climate  risk  management  is 

                                                           
5 <http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view=doc&lang=1&id=355945>. 
12 | P a g e  
 

needed  to  sustain  the  capacity  to  implement  specific  measures  at  sector  level,  based  on  a 
reasonable understanding of the risks. In the initial capacity development stage this is reflected in 
training and awareness rising among decision-makers and technical staff to develop foundational 
capacity. 

Given  the  fact  that  the  Ministry  of  Environment  does  not  have  a  special  structure  that  would 
develop  and  promote  an  effective  climate  change  policy,  the  capacity  building  becomes 
indispensable to this ministry by creating a division specialized in climate policies. Considering the 
need to integrate climate change aspects in  sectorial development policies, climate change units 
will also have to be created in the line ministries and these institutions shall be provided adequate 
financial resources. 

Building  the  capacities  of  governmental  institutions  to  manage  and  integrate  climate  change 
adaptation  in  sectoral  development  policies  and  sustainable  practices  to  be  implemented  at 
national and local levels will be initiated at the beginning of the implementation of the Strategy. A 
training program will be developed and implemented on building the capacity to integrate climate 
risks  and  disasters  in  sectoral  policies  and  sustainable  practices  related  to  climate  change 
adaptation methods, adapted to the needs of local and national levels, and sector-specific issues, 
accordingly. 

Action 1.2: Mainstream climate change adaptation in the sectoral policies of national economy  

Responding to the risk posed by climate change will require coordinated and focused efforts of the 
Government in view of promoting policies and measures at national and sector levels to prevent 
adverse climate change effects. Central Public Authorities will need to amend the existing and/or 
develop new sectoral strategies and action plans on climate change adaptation to address climate 
risks as part of the policies and activities planned at sector level. 

Mainstreaming climate change risks and adaptation into the national framework requires several 
steps  to  assure  that  information  about  climate-related  risks,  vulnerability,  and  options  for 
adaptation is incorporated into planning and decision-making in key sectors as well as into existing 
national assessments and action plans.  

Broadly speaking, these steps include: understand climate risks and existing knowledge on climate 
change  adaptation;  assess  institutional  and  policy  implications  of  key  threats  posed  by  climate 
change;  amend  the  existing  and/or  develop  new  sectoral  strategies  and  action  plans  that  are 
climate-resilient.  

To  assure  the  implementation  of  these  policies,  actions  on  identifying  funds  for  adaptation, 
creating mechanisms for performance coordination and monitoring will be needed. As this process 
is  not  linear,  it  requires  that  new  information  on  climate  risks  and  adaptation  approaches  be 
continuously integration to minimize the impacts. 

The  implementation  of  climate  change  adaptation  measures  while  assuring  the  sustainable 
development  and  economic  growth  also  requires  the  improvement  of  the  existing  legal 
framework, the development of efficient financial instruments to implement these measures and 
a change in the behaviour and attitude to consumption mode and generation method.  

Thus, the relevant legislative acts will be reviewed to identify fields that do not enable the existing 
or potential adaptation activities, the legislation will be amended or new legislative and regulatory 
acts  will  be  developed  to  assure  that  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks  facilitate  climate 
change adaptation at all levels, including autonomous adaptation of individuals, communities and 
private sector. 

Action 1.3: Develop the communication and the institutional cooperation in view of implementing 
adaptation policies 

13 | P a g e  
 

In the spirit of joint action stemming from the general objective, public authorities will establish 
clear objectives and jointly achieve them, to protect the Republic of Moldova against the negative 
effects  of  climate  change.  They  will  propose  measures  and  solutions  and  will  implement actions 
under  the  leadership,  guidance  and  coordination  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  in  accordance 
with  the  national  priorities  and  the  European  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Policy  and  the 
obligations  of  the  country  under  the  Republic  of  Moldova-EU  Association  Agreement  (AA)  to 
implement these policies. Following the courses of action set out, decision makers and those who 
assure  its  implementation  in  all  priority  sectors  should  cooperate  effectively  to  assure  a  secure 
future.  

Since  governmental  institutions  cannot  assume  themselves  the  responsibility  to  implement  of 
climate change adaptation measures, the whole society should be ready to respond to requests by 
going through a transition process of changing attitudes and actions, from a reactive to a proactive 
approach  to  a  climate  change  mitigation  policy,  fully  accepted,  adopted,  implemented,  and 
continuously  updated  by  the  Government.  Public  authorities  need  to  focus  on  the  cooperation 
with  the  business  community,  NGOs  and  academic/scientific  community  and  combine  the 
expertise  and  resources  to  raise  the  willingness  to  act.  Public  authorities  need  to  assure  the 
creation, sharing and dissemination of knowledge, as well as the exchange of best practices in all 
priority sectors. The development of public-private partnership will encourage for increasing the 
effectiveness  of  the  approach  specific  to  a  field.  Regional  and  international  cooperation  will  be 
also  developed,  and  as  long  as  the  provision  of  financial  resources  is  limited,  collaborative 
relationships with donor financial institutions will be developed. 

The  main  instrument  for  strengthening  the  cross-sector  coordination  will  be  Communication 
Strategy  on  Climate  Change  Adaptation,  which  will  establish  an  effective  mechanism  to 
disseminate,  among  relevant  ministries,  the  information  on  implementation  of  climate  change 
adaptation strategies, and as a feedback link inclusive, to have a two-way information flow. 

Specific  Objective  2:  Create  by  2020  a  mechanism  for  monitoring  the  climate  change  impact, 
related social and economic vulnerability, and managing/disseminating the information on climate 
risks and disasters 

The specific objective 2 will be implemented in three courses of action: 

Action  2.1:  Continuous  monitoring  and  research  of  climate  change  impacts,  related  social  and 
economic vulnerability, and periodic updating of climate scenarios 

Continuous  monitoring of  climate  change  impacts  at  the national  level allows  for  identifying the 
most likely evolution in this field, and providing opportunities for immediate action and decisions 
at the administrative level. As accurate as possible knowledge on potential climate change effects 
on economic and social sectors is needed to adopt effective climate change adaptation measures.  
Research activities need to be implemented on the following priorities: 

a)  determine  the  vulnerability  of  sectors,  regions  and  natural/anthropogenic  systems  when 

extreme weather events take place; 

b)  identify the  climate  change  evolution,  as  close  as  possible  to  the  regional  and  local  levels, 
and  develop  climate  maps  to  identify  at-risk  areas  in  the  country  to  undertake  priority 
actions. 

c)  develop climate scenarios (average conditions and various extreme weather events) that are 

based on regional climate models, and assess the uncertainties related to such scenarios; 

d)  carry out research on climate change impact on sectors, regions and natural/anthropogenic 

systems. 

Action 2.2: Create a climate change database 

14 | P a g e  
 

The Ministry of Environment will coordinate the creation of a national climate change database, 
acting in this regard jointly with the research institutions, academia, universities and NGOs. This 
database  will  contain  full  information  on  the  evolution  of  climatic  factors  such  as  temperature, 
rainfall  regimen,  etc., 
including  their  variability,  and  the  occurrence  of  extreme  hydro-
meteorological events. To create  such a database, all available information will be collected and 
areas  where  knowledge and  data  are  missing  will  be  identified.  The  database  will  be  completed 
and organized in a systematic manner so as to be easily accessible to stakeholders.  The database 
will be expanded at the local level, as authorities at this level are the ones who often implement 
measures, which are not part of the central governmental structures' duties. A model of creating 
this database is the Clearinghouse Mechanism, developed at European level, which will be a tool 
for collecting and disseminating climate change information, data and case studies, and will also 
help to increase the coordination between the relevant sectoral policies. 

Capacity  building  and  strengthening  of  the  national  system  of  statistics  collection/monitoring, 
reporting,  to  assure  adequate  management  of  electronic  databases  for  periodic  hydro-
meteorological  and  climate  information  and  other  data  needed  to  assess  climate  risks  and 
impacts,  will  be  considered  some  of  the  important  elements for  assuring  the  implementation  of 
the national climate change adaptation policy.  

Action  2.3:  Raise  the  awareness  of  all  stakeholders  on  climate  change  risks  and  adaptation 
measures 

To  implement  climate  change  adaptation  policies,  the  whole  society  together  with  public 
authorities,  companies  and  NGOs,  will  assure  an  appropriate  level  of  knowledge  about  climate 
change  and  its  expected  effects.  The  awareness  on  the  need  to  promote  climate  change 
adaptation measures will facilitate the needed shift in attitudes and  behaviour, and will improve 
the  overall  capacity  to  mitigate  climate  change  effects.  Awareness  raising  actions  will  be 
developed based on the need to change the attitudes and  behaviour towards the use of natural 
resources, environmental protection and especially to climate change and the urgency of climate 
change adaptation actions. 

At the same time, inclusion of climate change adaptation issues in the curricula at all levels and in 
the  professional  training  process  plays  a  very  important  role  in  the  development  of  appropriate 
attitudes, so that young people and children have access to information on disaster and climate 
risk, appropriate emergency response and long-term adaptation options. 

To  achieve  this  goal,  an  effective  awareness  campaign  will  be  conducted  on  climate  change 
adaptation issue, on the potential and the current risks and threats associated with climate change 
and on the needed preventive actions. Raising the awareness level, disseminating information and 
proper  training  are  essential  elements  in  the  decentralization  of  the  efforts  of  identifying  and 
implementing  specific  adaptation  measures.  The  promotion  and  implementation  of  the  Strategy 
on  communicating  climate  change  impacts  and  possible  responses  to  them  will  be  of  particular 
importance  in  this  regard,  including  a  public  information  and  awareness  campaign  through 
appropriate mass-media.  

An early warning system on natural disasters of climatic origin will be created, by providing access 
for public to data and information needed to assess the climate risks and impacts, as well as the 
publication  of  regular  monitoring  reports  as  part  of  the  strategy  for  communication  of  climate 
change  impacts.  By  assuring  the  appropriate  level  of  awareness  and  sensitivity,  obvious 
behavioural changes are expected in society and at the community level. 

Specific Objective 3: Assure the development of climate resilience by reducing at least by 50% the 
climate  change  vulnerability  and  facilitate  climate  change  adaptation  in  six  priority  sectors 
(agriculture, water resources, forestry, human health, energy and transport) by 2020. 

15 | P a g e  
 

Climate  change  adaptation  process  will  take  place  in  different  sectors  and  at  different  levels 
(national, regional, local) with a customized approach for each sector/location. As climate change 
has  a  different  impact  across  the  sectors  and  at  different  levels,  measures  on  adaptation  to 
climate  change  effects  will  also  be  different  but  will  respect  the  same  parameters.  To  provide 
viable  sectoral  solutions,  adaptation  will  be  mainstreamed  in  planning  the  development  of  the 
given  sector  and  will  be  achieved  by  close  cooperation  between  stakeholders.  In  this  regard, 
adaptation  measures  will  be  mainstreamed  in  the  current  sectoral  policies,  or  new  Strategies 
and/or Action Plans for risk mitigation and climate change adaptation will be developed. 

Thus,  for  each  relevant  sector  specific  measures  will  be  identified  and  implemented  taking  into 
account: 

a)  assessment  of  the  current  stage  (actions  undertaken,  their  results,  etc.)  and  experience 

gained; 

b)  general objectives, intermediate objectives and measures to be taken to achieve them; 
c)  indicators to monitor the progress of their implementation; 
d)  present and future research needs; 
e)  available and needed resources; 
f)  the institutional framework for implementation, and allocation of responsibilities; 
g)  risk management tools; 
h)  best practices for the integration of climate change adaptation measures in the development 

of national policies. 

If  necessary,  the  legal  framework,  regulations  and  financial  instruments  will  be  amended  to 
implement  climate  change  adaptation.  Development  and  implementation  of  all  climate  change 
adaptation  measures  will  be  coordinated  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  achieved  by  line 
ministries.

20 | P a g e  
 

which,  respectively,  assures  the  revitalisation  and  renewal  of  bituminous  binder  quality, 
reducing the fragility of the upper asphalt layer, increasing its elasticity and flexibility, and its 
resilience to water and chemicals); 

d)  wider use of efficient road maintenance methods (preventive maintenance: include coatings,

stations. 

A.IV. Gaps and barriers  

a) Policy framework 

*  Lack  of  effective  enforcement  presents  the  key  challenge  facing  implementation  of  the 

* 

adaptation action plans; enforcement is specifically critical at the local level; 
Insufficient inter-institutional coordination of the implementation of national policies and 
strategies; 

*  Limited awareness on cross-sector-based policies and strategies;  
*  Systemic  level  impediments  on  enhancing  the  political  commitment  to  address  climate 

adaptation; 

*  Limited  capacities  (time,  personnel  and  funding  resources)  to  review  and  amend  and/or 
develop  new  national  policies  and  strategies  focused  on  integrating  climate  change  and 
disaster risk reduction considerations. 

b) Coordination mechanisms 

*  Systemic level impediments to effective use of multi-level and multi-sector climate change 
coordination  mechanisms  to  address  climate  change  impacts  and  strengthen  adaptive 
responses; 

*  Lack  of  an  integrated,  comprehensive  and  efficient  monitoring  of  climate  change 

adaptation implementation;  

*  Limited  number  of  climate  change  policies  and  limited  references  to  them  make 

coordination mechanisms difficult, mainly ad-hoc and project driven;  

*  Limited use of criteria and indicators to guide and monitor the coordination work;  
*  Limited capacity of lead agencies to coordinate and promote a higher degree of local level 
involvement combined with a limited understanding and awareness by local authorities on 
climate change impacts and adaptation approaches to climate change; 

*  A  link  between  climate  change  coordinating  mechanisms  and  other  relevant  national 

coordinating mechanisms has yet to be established. 

c) Institutional capacities and planning process 

*  The country still lacks a programmatic approach to addresses multiple sectors and levels of 

governance; it is envisaged that the next (4 year based) NAP, will address this aspect; 

*  The lack of an integrated planning process between the central public authority institutions 

and uncoordinated allocation of financial resources through various national funds; 

21 | P a g e  
 

*  Concerns  from  high-level  officials  on  the  implications  of  following  a  programmatic 

approach;  

*  Limited 

institutional  capacities  to  design,  develop, 

implement  and  coordinate  a 

programmatic approach;  

*  Lack of national policies and strategies that can guide a programmatic approach;  
*  Lack of a coherent presentation of statistical data between central public authorities; 
*  Limited technical and staffing capacity in addressing climate change issues;  
*  Non-coherent system of access to information for central and local public authorities. 

d) Mainstreaming climate change adaptation into policies, plans and budgetary processes  

*  Limited understanding at national and sectoral levels of the concept of mainstreaming and 

how it can be undertaken;  

*  Climate  change  and  climate  change  adaptation  are  not  mainstreamed  into  national 

legislation on human health and related social services; 

*  Limited  understanding  by  policymakers  of  the  looming  threat  of  climate  change  as  a 
development  issue  and  its  links  with,  and  implications  for,  resource  allocation,  economic 
growth and ecosystem services. 

e) Technology transfer  

*  Low  skills  and  knowledge  on  climate  adaptive  solutions;  lack  of  advisory  services  in  the 

context of identifying adaptation measures for different sectors; 

*  Low  level  of  public-private  partnerships  in  implementing  climate  change  adaption 

measures; 

*  Undeveloped  market  and  mechanism  to  promote  technology  innovations  and  adaptive 

technology transfer;  

*  Lack of comprehensive climate change and disaster management risks databases; 
*  Lack  of  documents  of  major  importance  for  the  territorial  planning,  such  as  the  National 
and  Regional  Spatial  Plans,  General  Urban  Plans  of  the  cities;  these  documents  would 
contribute to the identification of adaptation actions at the local and regional level, and to 
improving the situation in the context of urban planning; 

*  Slow  reforms  and  adoption  of  new  technical  and  normative  standards  in  transport  and 

building sectors (adoption of Eurocodes); and reduced financial allocations for this task;  

*  Lack of medium to long-term investment planning, with little efforts on prevention adverse 

impacts of climate change, relying more on post factum removing of adverse effects; 
Inappropriate financial incentives and disincentives for adaptive technology transfer; 
Inadequate rural infrastructure and tenurial arrangements for climate change adaptation. 

* 
* 

f) Financing climate change adaptation interventions  

*  There is no integration of climate change adaptation measures into the national budget; 
*  No dedicated budget to specific climate change adaptation activities;  
*  No financial  strategy developed for adaptation to climate change;  
*  No climate indicators incorporated into planning and budgeting framework; 
*  No contingency budget in specific sectors for adaptation interventions. 

A.V. Summary of needs  

a) Research and development needs to meet adaptation targets 

National research on climate change has to be linked to international research efforts and has to 
apply  the  knowledge  gained  at  this  level.  Experienced  research  institutes  will  be  encouraged  to 
participate  in  supporting  the  development  of  the  national  climate  change  policy.  Since  most 

22 | P a g e  
 

research  institutes  conduct  studies  only  on  a  contractual  basis,  adequate  financial  resources  are 
crucial for conducting climate change research, and collaborative relationships will be developed 
with  international  financial  institutions  as  long  as  financial  resources  remain  limited  for  a  long 
time. A major emphasis will be placed on building the capacities of Working Group members for 
climate  modelling  to  develop  climate  models  and  perform  impact  assessment  studies,  for 
example,  by  facilitating  the  exchange  of  experience  and  research  visits  to  international  climate 
modelling centres. 

It  is  equally  important  to  monitor  the  climate  change  impact  and  conduct  research  in  priority 
sectors such as: Agriculture, Health, Forestry, Energy, Transport, Water Resources etc. 

Agriculture Sector 

*  Research  needs  to  address  not  only  change  in  temperature  and  precipitation  and  its 
impacts on agriculture, but also the interaction with hazards, directly or indirectly arising 
from  atmospheric  conditions,  such  as  rainfall,  flood,  frost,  drought,  hail,  heat  waves, 
seasonal shifts (length of growing season, bud break, quality aspects), and changes in pest 
and disease patterns.  

*  Crop  specific  evaluations  should  be  conducted  to  determine  changes  in  seasonal 
development,  characteristics  of  production,  cultivation  methods,  etc.,  under  climate 
change.  

*  Crop  models  are  required  to  assess  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  increased 

atmospheric concentration of CO2 on various crops, pastureland and livestock.  

*  Further,  crop  simulation  models  need  to  be  interfaced  with  Geographic  Information 
Systems  (GIS)  in  order that these  models  can  be  applied for  regional planning  and policy 
analysis.  
In addition, a variety of approaches, such as economic regression models, microeconomic 
and macroeconomic models, and farm models should be used. 

* 

Health Sector  

*  Quantitative research is required to identify the regions of the Republic of Moldova most 

vulnerable to the adverse health effects of climate change.  

*  These areas  will  require  focused  adaptation  measures,  including better health  clinics and 
tools,  education  of  the  public  in  these  areas  about  how  they  can  cope  with  new  health 
concerns.  
Improved disease burden estimates need to be established, based on latest climate models 
to estimate:  

* 

o  heat-related mortality statistics based on existing mortality and population data at 

the national level and in key cities of the Republic of Moldova;  

o  the  impacts  of  projected  changes  in  climate,  taking  into  account  various  forms  of 

acclimatization/adaptation; and  

o  climate-water  and  foodborne  diseases  relationships  using  panel  data  on  income 
and health to project cause-specific deaths and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
rates by demographic group.  

*  Further in depth studies on the socio-economic assessment of climate change in the health 

sector would be beneficial, including:  

o  the health 'damage' costs of climate change under different mitigation scenarios;  
o  the costs of preventing death, illness and injury under different mitigation scenarios 

(i.e. adaptation measures).

Water Resources Sector  

Improving the capacity to calibrate state-of-the art rainfall runoff models;  

*  Defining critical thresholds in water resource;  
* 
*  Understanding  of  the  economic  and  social  impacts  of  climate  change  on  water  quantity, 
supply,  and  demand  including  irrigation,  drinking-water  supplies,  recreation/tourism, 
hydropower and industry, and system losses;  

*  The capacities of developing and implementing systems of hydro-economic assessment of 
river basin will be enhanced to assess the further development of water resources and the 
related  sustainable  development,  such  as  hydro-electric  development,  waste  treatment 
and irrigated agriculture; 

*  Pre-feasibility  or  feasibility  studies  for  irrigation  and  land  use  projects  are  needed 
(including from groundwater sources), and should be required to include an assessment of 
the physical and economic impacts of climate change;  

*  Assessments  and  analyses  on  social,  economic  and  environmental  costs  and  benefits  of 

future adaptations will be performed. 

Forestry Sector  

*  Establishing  the  climatic  thresholds  that  correspond  to  the  distribution  limits  of  a  forest 
type  or  species  and  develop  a  bioclimatic  model  to  predict  future  steady-state  forest 
distributions under a range of plausible climate change scenarios;  

*  Collecting  historical  analogues  and  life-history  information  to  estimate  how  long  it  might 

take for the forest boundary to migrate a given distance;  

*  Calibrating a biogeochemistry model to predict changes in productivity and carbon stocks 

in each forest type, with and without the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations;  

*  Evaluation of adaptive capacity including the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest 
ecosystems  and  the  socioeconomic factors determining the  ability to  implement planned 
adaptation measures. 

Energy Sector  

*  Assessing  the  possible  effects  (both  positive  and  negative)  of  climate  change  on  energy 

consumption:  

o  effects of climate warming on energy use for space heating;  
o  effects of climate warming on energy use for space cooling;  
o  market  penetration  of  air  conditioning  and  heat  pumps  (all-electric  heating  and 

cooling), and changes in humidity;  

*  Conducting studies possible effects on energy generation and supply:  

o  assessment  of  impact  of  increase  temperatures  and  droughts  on  hydro  energy 

potential;  
impacts of climate change on energy generation from biomass;  

o 
o  wind resources changes (intensity and duration); and  
o  electricity transmission and distribution;  

*  Research on efficiency of energy use in the context of global warming, with an emphasis on 

technologies and practices that save cooling energy and reduce electrical peak load.  

Transport Sector  

*  Examining  the  long-term  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  Transport  Sector  in  light  of 
climate change projections to determine whether, when, and where the impacts could be 
consequential,  particularly 
long  planning  horizons  for  transport 
infrastructure;  

light  of  the 

in 

24 | P a g e  
 

*  Analysing  options  for  adapting  to  these  impacts,  including  the  possible  need  to  alter 
assumptions  about  infrastructure  design  and  operations,  the  ability  to  incorporate 
uncertainty into long-range decision making, and the capability of institutions to plan and 
act on mitigation and adaptation strategies at the state and regional levels. 

The  promoted  studies  on  climate  change  and  on  the  vulnerability  to  its  effects  enable  better 
knowledge about sectors, ecosystems and regions that are particularly exposed to climate change, 
facilitating  the  identification  and  promotion  of  vigorous  and  effective  actions  for  mitigating  the 
adverse effects of climate change in the country. The findings of these studies will substantiate the 
adoption  of  planned  adaptation  measures  and  will  help  to  increase  the  domestic  adaptation 
capacity  in  line  with  the  achievement  of  objectives  and  national  sustainable  development  and 
environmental protection priorities. 

b) Needs for support required to execute current and mid-term adaptation undertakings 

The  implementation  of  climate  change  adaptation  objectives  needs  to  be  supported  by 
appropriate financial mechanisms. The implementation cost of the Republic of Moldova's Climate 
Change Adaptation Strategy until 2020 and the Action Plan on its implementation is estimated at 
about US$ 200 million.  

The  cost  of  inaction  could  be  devastating,  given  the  fact  that  natural  disasters  alone  cause  the 
country  an  average  loss  of  about  US$  61  million  each  year.  The  estimates  of  future  costs  and 
benefits suggest that every euro spent on flood protection would avoid six euros of cost generated 
by damage.  

The  provision  and  allocation  of  adequate  financial  resources  are  prerequisites  for  achieving  a 
successful  outcome  of  the  climate  change  adaptation  process.  To  support  climate  change 
adaptation initiatives, both domestic financial resources as well as international ones are required. 
Domestic  financing  can  be  secured  both  from  the  state  budget  and  from  other  financial 
mechanisms  (special  funds:  National  Ecological  Fund,  National  Fund  for  Regional  Development, 
etc.).  They  will  be  important  tools  for  directing  the  domestic  monetary  flows  in  environmental 
investments,  and  a  means  of  strengthening  the  external  and  domestic  financing).  Foreign 
assistance  and  investments  is  envisaged  to  play  the  most  important  role  in  promoting  climate 
change  actions  in  all  economic  sectors  and  in  catalysing  the  specific  investments  that  will  be 
needed to  assure  climate  change  adaptation  in the  Republic  of  Moldova.  These investments  are 
linked  to  a  wide  range  of  technologies  intended  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency,  use  of 
renewable  energy,  develop  the  related  road  and  building  infrastructure,  and  finally  adapt  to 
climate change. In this context, the international financial support is needed to implement in full 
extent the appropriate national and sectorial policies and strategies, or to resolve specific issues in 
the  fields  where the  climate  change  impact  is  significant.  Implementation  of  small  and  medium-
scale  pilot  and  demonstration  projects  will  involve  sustainability  of  external  assistance  to  be 
received, including through financial mechanisms available under the UNFCCC.  

It  is  anticipated,  that  the  Strategy's  objectives  will  be  achieved  to  a  greater  extent  under  the 
conditions  in  which  the  Republic  of  Moldova  gains  access  to  the  financial  mechanisms  of  the 
UNFCCC,  specifically  to  the  Green  Climate  Fund,  Special  Climate  Change  Fund,  Adaptation  Fund 
and  others,  in  view  of  implementing  adaptation  projects  in  the  most  vulnerable  sectors  of  the 
national economy. 

c) Summary of recent external support 

According  to  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  on-line 
database (see figure 6), Moldova ranks among the top ten countries of Europe that benefit from 

25 | P a g e  
 

external assistance. Also, it was the sixth country in Europe by development cooperation received, 
with a 5 per cent average of all the assistance provided to the region for 2011-2013.6

In  September  2009,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Moldova  addressed  to  the  donor 
community  with  the  request  for  support  in  implementing  the  priority  reforms  for  the  country's 
economic  growth,  specified  in  the  "We  are  relaunching  Moldova"  paper.  As  a  result,  during  the 
reunion  of  the  Advisory  Group  "Partnership  for  Moldova  Forum,"  held  in  Brussels  on  24  March 
2010, the donors community committed to allocate to Moldova 1.84 billion euros (0.96 billion in 
the  form  of  grant,  52%  of  the  total;  respectively,  0.88  billion  in  the  form  of  credits,  48%  of  the 
total)  for  the  2011-2013  period.  As  a  whole,  the  USA  (through  the  Compact  Program  of  the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation of the USAID, signed in 2010 in the amount of USD 262 million) 
has become one of Moldova's main bilateral development partners. The EU commitment and of 
the  EU  member  states  on  future  allocations  have  accounted  for  40%  of  the  resources  promised 
during the reunion.  

Towards the end of 2012, over 70% of the resources provided in the 2010 Brussels reunion had 
been  contracted,  through  specific  projects  started  in  various  national  economy  sectors.  In 
addition, external funds of about 800 million euros have been attracted.  Thus, a total amount of 
2.6 billion euros were provided to the Republic of Moldova by the donor community in the 2010-
2012 periods (by 40% more as compared to the financial commitments made during the Brussels 
reunion).  

In 2012 the donor funds were estimated at about 474 million euros. According to the data of the 
State Chancery of the Republic of Moldova, the budget of the projects contracted in the reporting 
period account for about 206 million euros and the disbursements reported by the donors - about 
465  million  euros  (about  98%  of  the  estimated  amount).  For  comparison,  in  2007  the 
disbursements amounted to 266 million euros; in 2008 - 298 million euros; in 2009 - 244 million 
euros;  in  2010  -  470  million  euros;  in  2011  -  451  million  euros.  For  2013  and  2014  there  are 
provided 322 million and 213 million euros, respectively. 

The manner of cooperation between the Republic of Moldova and the development partners has 
taken various forms: technical assistance, support for implementing various investment or social 
projects,  the  support  provided  to  the  budget  for  implementing  sector  policies  or  the  support 
provided for supporting the state's payment balance. The objectives of the cooperation between 
the Government and its partners are agreed upon and stipulated in the medium-term framework 
cooperation agreements.  

According to the data available for external development assistance, the highest share is held by 
the  assistance  with  project  implementation  (75%),  followed  by  sector  budget  assistance  (about 
17%), technical assistance, and assistance with maintaining the state payment balance. Given the 
budgetary constraints and of state debt servicing, the manner of attraction of external resources 
that is preferred by the Government are grants and/or concessional credits.  

The  amount  of  on-going  external  assistance  in  2012,  according  to  the  information  from  the 
database of the State Chancery, the Republic of Moldova accounted for about 1.1 billion euros in 
the  form  of  grants  and  682.8  million  euros  in  the  form  of  loans.  Accordingly,  in  2012,  the 
contracted resources were distributed as follows: about 109.4 million euros in the form of grants 
and 97.1 million euros in loans (EBRD, EIB, WB). The share of active grants in the total amount of 
external assistance has represented about 62%. For 2012, the grant-credit parity represented 53%, 
accordingly, 47% of the total amount of external assistance contracted during the year.  

By the  end  of  2012,  the  Republic  of  Moldova  was  implementing  384  projects  in  various  sectors, 
including  116  projects  in  governance  and  civil  society,  58  projects  in  infrastructure  and  social 
services,  49  projects  in  education,  31  projects  in  agriculture,  29  multi-sectorial  projects,  24 
projects for private sector development, 19 projects in the environment and 16 projects related to 
energy generation and supply.  

27 | P a g e  
 

As a total, in 2012, there were launched 98 new projects, with new commitments in the amount of 
206.6 million euros in various sectors. For 2013, the estimated amount of external assistance was 
314 million euros. 

It was quite difficult to estimate the external support allocated to date, specifically for adaptation-
related work, as part of these projects and support received is cross-cutting and/or inter-sectorial, 
covering both mitigation and adaptation aspects. 

On  November  6,  2014  EU  Commissioner  for  European  Neighborhood  Policy  and  Enlargement 
Negotiations  and  Prime-minister  of  the  Republic  of  Moldova  signed  the  Memorandum  of 
Understanding  on  the  Single  Support  Framework  for  EU  support to  the Republic  of  Moldova for 
the period of 2014-2017 together with a financing agreement to support the implementation of 
the  Association  Agreement  (AA)  and  the  Deep  and  Comprehensive  Free  Trade  Area  (DCFTA)  - 
which the Republic of Moldova signed with the EU on 27 June 2014.  

The three priority sectors are:  

*  public administration reform;  
*  agriculture and rural development;  
*  policy reform and border management.  

The financial assistance for the period 2014-2017 amounts to EUR 410 million and EUR 30 million 
for DCFTA. 

A.VI. Monitoring and reporting progress 

The  Republic  of  Moldova's  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Strategy  until  2020  will  be  implemented 
through  an  Action  Plan.  To  assure  the  financial  support  for  the  activities  planned  in  the  Action 
Plan, such activities will be included in the sectoral strategies for mid-term expenditures and in the 
annual work plans of institutions involved in this Strategy implementation. 

The responsibility for implementing the Strategy rests with all competent institutions identified in 
the Action Plan.  

The National Commission for implementation of mechanisms and provisions of the UNFCCC and of 
the Kyoto Protocol will coordinate the implementation and will conduct regular assessment of the 
level of indicators and progress achievement.  

The monitoring of the Strategy implementation will be carried out by the Ministry of Environment 
of the Republic of Moldova, where a subdivision will be designated for that purpose.  

Based on the collected and systematized information, it will prepare annual monitoring reports on 
implementation  of  the  Strategy  and  will  submit  them  for  consideration  and  approval  to  the 
Government. 

The  monitoring  reports  to  be  developed  will  include  information  on  the  implementation  of  the 
indicators  set  in  the  Action  Plan  for  each  action,  and  every  3  years  or  as  needed  progress 
evaluation reports will be developed as well to assess the impact of activities carried out during 
the given time and the level of objectives implementation.  

As  the  Strategy  was  not  designed  as  a  linear,  but  as  an  iterative  process,  therefore  it  will  be 
updated and reviewed periodically, based on the monitoring and evaluation findings, as well as on 
the updated climate models, and in accordance with the most recent scientific researches.  

Towards  the  end  of  the  Strategy  implementation,  a  final  assessment  report,  containing 
information  on  the  level  of  achievement  of  objectives  and  of  the  expected  impact,  will  be 
prepared. Based on this report, the next stage of strategic planning of climate  change adaptation 
has to be decided. 

28 | P a g e  
 

Further, the Republic of Moldova will put in place a four year based NAPs and SAPs. The proposed 
framework for NAPs and SAPs will allow for monitoring and planning along a 3-tier M&E approach.  

First tier, macro-level monitoring would allow for tracking the evolution of the national adaptation 
planning process as a whole.   

This  would  entail  the  development  of  a  number  of  process-oriented  indicators  that  would  be 
followed across sectors. Examples of such indicators could include: number of SAPs; overall level 
of Government funding channelled towards adaptation needs; index of resilience/vulnerability of 
the Moldovan economy, etc. These indicators would provide an image of the overall dynamism of 
the adaptation planning process as a whole.  As such, they may depend on the aggregation of data 
from lower-level indicators (e.g., data on adaptation funding by sector). The final indicator on level 
of resilience would allow for tracking of the impact of the adaptation process as a whole.  It would 
have  to  be  computed  from  recognized  vulnerability  indices  and  legitimate  sources  of  data.  The 
next NAP will be used to develop the ‘Index', ‘Methodology' and to gather ‘Baseline Data'.  

Second  tier,  meso-level  monitoring  would  allow  for  tracking  of  progress  and  results  at  a 
disaggregated level, either sectoral or geographic (e.g., regional), depending on the choices made 
during planning phases.  

These indicators would depend on the provision of data from regional or sectoral authorities. Such 
indicators  would  be  the  following:  the  number  and  type  of  adaptation  measures  included  in 
sectoral/regional  plans,  proportion  of  sectoral  budget  dedicated  to  adaptation  measures, 
number/type  of  sectoral  stakeholders  implementing  adaptation  or  resilient  measures,  degree  to 
which the sector/region's vulnerability has been reduced.   

Similarly to the first tier, the final indicator would be an ‘Index' for which the ‘Methodology' would 
be determined in the early phases of NAP planning.  Also, while these indicators remain somewhat 
process-oriented, it could be possible to adopt more concrete indicators within each sector (e.g., if 
water availability was a constraint to resilience, the water sector M&E framework could adopt an 
indicator on "overall water availability").  

Sector-specific indicators would have to be agreed upon during the early phases of NAPs or SAPs 
planning,  and  could  be  renewed,  depending  on  their  relevance,  at  the  end  of  each  planning 
period. However, it would be important to keep a number of indicators similar from one sector to 
the  next,  to  enable  comparisons.  The  prioritization  of  adaptation  measures  will  be  done  by  the 
sectors or stakeholders participating in the development and implementation of NAPs and SAPs.   

Each  time  a  SAP  or  a  NAP  is  proposed,  it  should  contain  prioritized  measures  for  that  planning 
period. The process of determining the prioritization and selection of certain adaptation options 
over others should be transparent, and based on rationalized criteria. Ideally, it would be carried 
out by a stakeholder group, which can consider different economic, environmental, social, cultural 
or political spheres and concerns. The M&E system will verify if the planned measures have been 
implemented accordingly. The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Multi 
Criteria  Decision  Analysis  (MCDA)  and  other  relevant  to  case  econometric  assessment  methods 
and tools will be used. 

Third tier, a micro-level structure of reporting would also be defined. This would concern indicators 
related to specific adaptation actions that are adopted within individual sectoral or national plan. 
For each action or group of actions, a target and an indicator have to be developed (e.g., number 
of people trained; hectares of forest protected; kilometres of road upgraded; degree of water use 
(drop-per-crop) efficiency in the wine sector, etc.). Each of these indicators should be attached to 
the actions contained in the specific sectoral or regional action plan.  As such, they would serve as 
the basis level of results tracking by stakeholders, and would be reported upon annually at least.  
They could be modified at each round of successive planning, and be aggregated to feed into the 

29 | P a g e  
 

meso-  and  macro-level  reporting  frameworks.  Responsibility  for  providing  information  on  these 
indicators  would  rest  upon  those  who  will  also  be  tasked  with  the  implementation  of  the 
adaptation actions. 

 

The milestones for reporting under the national adaptation planning process would be as follows:  

*  micro-level indicators: annually;  
*  meso- and macro-level indicators: every two year.  

As  each  NAP  will  be  set  for  four  years,  this  would  mean  that  results  could  be  tracked  and 
aggregated  twice  per  period,  allowing  for  an  informed  planning  process  for  the  next  phases. 
Naturally, the first planning period would also entail a baseline assessment of key indicators, and 
some time to develop the methodologies and indices.  

At the end of a planning cycle, the data would be aggregated into a "NAP Impact Study", which 
would synthesize all results achieved during the period and make recommendations for the next 
period. This study will be submitted for consideration to the Government.    

The main responsibility for reporting will be of the sectoral administrations, which would need to 
undertake annual and biennial reporting for micro- and meso-level indicators.  All data would be 
provided  to  the  coordination  mechanism,  whose  secretariat  could  synthesize  information  to 
develop reports.  The Secretariat would also provide sectoral administrations with templates and 
formats  in  order  to  allow  for  standardized  tracking.    Also,  a  database  would  be  created  to  be 
administered  by  the  coordination  mechanism,  being  accessible  however  to  all  participating 
administrations,  in  order  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  information.  In  addition,  micro-level  reporting 
could be undertaken with the participation of local NGOs and associations which would participate 
in the implementation of targeted adaptation measures. Participation of NGOs at all levels of the 
M&E  framework  would  allow  for  increased  transparency  and  for  broader  ownership  and 
dissemination of results.   

As adaptation planning is an iterative process,  gradually growing in scope and learning from the 
monitoring and review of  on-going adaptation actions, a description of how adaptation progress 
will be nationally monitored, reviewed, updated, and reported can be an important element.

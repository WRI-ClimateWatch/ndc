强化应对气候变化行动 

——中国国家自主贡献 

 

气候变化是当今人类社会面临的共同挑战。工业革命以来

的人类活动，特别是发达国家大量消费化石能源所产生的二氧

化碳累积排放，导致大气中温室气体浓度显著增加，加剧了以

变暖为主要特征的全球气候变化。气候变化对全球自然生态系

统产生显著影响，温度升高、海平面上升、极端气候事件频发

给人类生存和发展带来严峻挑战。 

气候变化作为全球性问题，需要国际社会携手应对。多年

来，各缔约方在《联合国气候变化框架公约》（以下简称公约）

实施进程中，按照共同但有区别的责任原则、公平原则、各自

能力原则，不断强化合作行动，取得了积极进展。为进一步加

强公约的全面、有效和持续实施，各方正在就 2020 年后的强

化行动加紧谈判磋商，以期于 2015 年年底在联合国气候变化

巴黎会议上达成协议，开辟全球绿色低碳发展新前景，推动世

界可持续发展。 

中国是拥有 13 多亿人口的发展中国家，是遭受气候变化

不利影响最为严重的国家之一。中国正处在工业化、城镇化快

 
速发展阶段，面临着发展经济、消除贫困、改善民生、保护环

境、应对气候变化等多重挑战。积极应对气候变化，努力控制

温室气体排放，提高适应气候变化的能力，不仅是中国保障经

济安全、能源安全、生态安全、粮食安全以及人民生命财产安

全，实现可持续发展的内在要求，也是深度参与全球治理、打

造人类命运共同体、推动全人类共同发展的责任担当。 

根据公约缔约方会议相关决定，在此提出中国应对气候变

化的强化行动和措施，作为中国为实现公约第二条所确定目标

做出的、反映中国应对气候变化最大努力的国家自主贡献，同

时提出中国对 2015 年协议谈判的意见，以推动巴黎会议取得

圆满成功。

ENHANCED ACTIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE:  

CHINA' S INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS1 

 

Climate  change  is  today's  common  challenge  faced  by  all  humanity.  Human 

activities  since  the  Industrial  Revolution,  especially  the  accumulated  carbon 

dioxide  emissions  from  the  intensive  fossil  fuels  consumption  of  developed 

countries,  have  resulted  in  significantly  increasing  the  atmospheric  concentration 

of greenhouse gases, exacerbated climate change primarily characterized by global 

warming.  Climate  change  has  significant  impacts  on  global  natural  ecosystems, 

causing temperature increase and sea level rise as well as  more frequent extreme 

climate events, all of which pose a huge challenge to the survival and development 

of the human race. 

Climate change is a global issue that requires the collaboration of the international 

community.  For  years,  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  equity  and  common 

but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities,  the  Parties  to  the 

United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (hereinafter  referred 

to  as  the  Convention)  have  been  working  to  enhance  cooperation  and  achieved  

positive progress in the implementation of the Convention. To further enhance the 

full,  effective  and  sustained  implementation  of  the  Convention,  negotiations  and 

consultations are now under way on enhanced actions beyond 2020, so as to reach 

an agreement at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention in Paris at the end 

                                                        
1 This  is  an  unofficial  translation.  In  case  of  any  divergence,  the  official  text  in  the  Chinese 

language shall prevail.  
of 2015. This will open up a new prospect for green and low-carbon development 

across the globe and promote sustainable development worldwide. 

As  a  developing  country  with  a  population  of  more  than  1.3  billion,  China  is 

among  those  countries  that  are  most  severely  affected  by  the  adverse  impacts  of 

climate  change.  China  is  currently  in  the  process  of  rapid  industrialization  and 

urbanization,  confronting  with  multiple  challenges 

including  economic 

development, poverty eradication, improvement of living standards, environmental 

protection  and  combating  climate  change.  To  act  on  climate  change  in  terms  of 

mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing climate resilience, is not only 

driven  by  China's  domestic  needs  for  sustainable  development  in  ensuring  its 

economic  security,  energy  security,  ecological  security,  food  security  as  well  as 

the  safety  of  people's  life  and  property  and  to  achieve  sustainable  development, 

but also driven by its sense of responsibility to fully engage in global governance, 

to  forge  a  community  of  shared  destiny  for  humankind  and  to  promote  common 

development for all human beings. 

In  accordance  with  relevant  decisions  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the 

Convention, China hereby presents its enhanced actions and measures on climate 

change as its nationally determined contributions towards achieving the objective 

set  out  in  Article  2  of  the  Convention,  which  represent  its  utmost  efforts  in 

addressing  climate  change,  and  contributes  its  views  on  the  2015  agreement 

negotiations with a view to making the Paris Conference a great success. 

I.  ENHANCED ACTIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE 

China attaches great importance to addressing climate change since long, making 

it  a  significant  national  strategy  for  its  social  and  economic  development  and 

promoting  green  and  low-carbon  development  as  important  component  of  the 
ecological  civilization  process.  It  has  already  taken  a  series  of  climate  actions 

which represent a significant contribution to combating the global climate change. 

In  2009,  China  announced  internationally  that  by  2020  it  will  lower  carbon 

dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40% to 45% from the 2005 level, increase 

the  share  of  non-fossil  fuels  in  primary  energy  consumption  to  about  15%  and 

increase  the  forested  area  by  40  million  hectares  and  the  forest  stock  volume  by 

1.3 billion cubic meters compared to the 2005 levels. In this connection, China has 

enacted  and  implemented  the  National  Program  on  Climate  Change,  the  Work 

Plan  for  Controlling  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  during  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan 

Period,  the  Comprehensive  Work  Plan  for  Energy  Conservation  and  Emission 

Reduction for the 12th Five Year Plan Period, the 12th Five Year Plan for Energy 

Conservation  and  Emission  Reduction,  the  2014-2015  Action  Plan  for  Energy 

Conservation,  Emission  Reduction  and  Low-Carbon  Development,  and  the 

National  Plan  on  Climate  Change  (2014-2020).  China  has  accelerated  the 

adjustment  of  its  industry  and  energy  structures  and  invested  great  efforts  in 

improving  energy  efficiency,  lowering  carbon  emissions  and  enhancing  the 

ecosystem.  China  has  initiated  carbon  emission  trading  pilots  in  7  provinces  and 

cities  and  low-carbon  development  pilots  in  42  provinces  and  cities  to  explore  a 

new  mode  of  low-carbon  development  consistent  with  its  prevailing  national 

circumstances. By 2014 the following has been achieved: 

•  Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP is 33.8% lower than the 2005 level; 

• 

• 

The share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption is 11.2%; 

The forested area and forest stock volume are increased respectively by 21.6 

million hectares and 2.188 billion cubic meters compared to the 2005 levels; 

• 

The installed capacity of hydro power is 300 gigawatts (2.57 times of that for 

2005); 

• 

The installed capacity of on-grid wind power is 95.81 gigawatts (90 times of 

that for 2005); 
• 

The installed capacity of solar power is 28.05 gigawatts (400 times of that for 

2005); and 

• 

The installed capacity  of nuclear power is 19.88  gigawatts (2.9 times of that 

for 2005). 

China  is  accelerating  the  implementation  of  the  National  Strategy  for  Climate 

Adaptation, and improving its capacity to respond to extreme climatic events and 

making  positive  progress  in  key  areas  of  climate  change  adaptation.  Capacity 

building on combating climate change is further strengthened. Supports in terms of 

science  and  technology  are  further  enhanced  by  implementing  China's  Science 

and Technology Actions on Climate Change. 

Looking  into  the  future,  China  has  defined  as  its  strategic  goals  to  complete  the 

construction of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020 and 

to  create  a  prosperous,  strong,  democratic,  culturally  developed  and  harmonious 

modern  socialist  country  by  the  middle  of  this  century.  It  has  identified 

transforming 

the  economic  development  pattern,  constructing  ecological 

civilization and holding to a green, low-carbon and recycled development path as 

its  policy  orientation.  New 

industrialization,  urbanization, 

informatization, 

agricultural  modernization  and  greenisation  will  be  promoted  in  a  coordinated 

manner.  Resource  conservation  and  environmental  protection  have  become  the

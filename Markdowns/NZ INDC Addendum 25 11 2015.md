Submission to the ADP 

 

Addendum to New Zealand's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

 

25 November 2015 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
New  Zealand  communicated  its  intended  nationally  determined  contribution  together  with 
accompanying information on 7 July 2015.   
 
New Zealand, through this submission, presents an addendum to its INDC to provide further 
clarity,  transparency  and  understanding  about  its  intended  approach  to  accounting  for 
emissions and removals from forestry and other land use in achieving our 2030 target. 
 
   
 
 
 

 

 
 
 

Addendum to New Zealand's INDC: Forestry assumptions and methodologies 

Approach to accounting for forestry and other land use 

Purpose of 
Addendum  

The purpose of this addendum is to enhance the clarity, transparency and 
understanding of New Zealand's INDC by setting out the assumptions about 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals from 
forestry and other land use underpinning the INDC submitted on 7 July 2015. 

Methodologies  New Zealand's accounting for forestry and other land use will be based on a 
combination of the 2006 IPCC Guidance and the 2013 IPCC Kyoto Protocol 
Supplement, providing for Kyoto Protocol accounting approaches to be applied 
to the GHG Inventory land-based categories. This approach recognises that 
accounting methodologies need to focus on anthropogenic effects, 
accommodate the specific biophysical characteristics of land use, and create 
efficient incentives for mitigation that can reconcile multiple sustainable land 
management objectives.  

Forestry and 
other land use 
approach 

New Zealand's forestry and other land use approach assumes accounting will 
be either land or activity based, and will apply existing IPCC methodologies to 
distinguish areas subject to direct human-induced change from those under 
pre-existing management, as follows:  

a. 

b. 

c. 

Forests established after the base year will continue to be accounted for 
as they would under the Kyoto Protocol, but once they attain their long-
term average carbon stock, taking into account all carbon pools and 
activities, the forest will transfer to the Forest management/Forest 
remaining forest category, where it will be accounted for under a 
business-as-usual reference level. New Zealand will continue to account 
for all deforestation emissions. 

Forests established before the base year will continue to be accounted 
for under a business-as-usual reference level, as per the Kyoto Protocol, 
to address the dynamic effects of age structure resulting from activities 
and practices before the reference year, and the ongoing cycles of forest 
harvest and regrowth that occur as part of normal, sustainable forest 
management.  

Accounting provisions to address natural disturbance, land-use flexibility, 
legacy effects, non-anthropogenic effects and additionality since the base 
year will also continue to apply, building on existing guidance. Harvested 
wood products accounting will be based on the production approach. 

New Zealand's forestry and other land use approach builds on experience with 
accounting under the Kyoto Protocol to recognise and focus on additional 
action, and will create incentives for the establishment of new forests, 
recognise permanent, long-term enhancements of carbon sinks resulting from 
new management, and take responsibility for deforestation, while 
accommodating the long-term cycles in net emissions and removals that arise 
from sustainable forest management.

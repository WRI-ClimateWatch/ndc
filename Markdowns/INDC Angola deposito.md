EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

The  contributions  of  Angola  to  this  INDC  are  in  the  framework  of  the  National  Strategy  for  the 
Implementation  of  UNFCCC  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  the  Strategy  to  Fight  Poverty  (SFP),  the 
National  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action  (NAPA)  and  Long  Term  Strategy  for  Development  of 
Angola (2025). 
 
Angola  is  committed  to  take  part  in  the  aspiration  set  at  International  level  to  fight  against  the 
phenomenon of climate change, thus contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. For this, Angola‟s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) encompasses for 
Mitigation  purposes  both  unconditional  and  conditional  measures  for  the  reduction  of  GHG.  The 
country is committed to stabilize its emissions, and contribute to climate change mitigation by 2030, 
targeting the following sectors:  
 

*  Power generation from renewable sources; and  
*  Reforestation.  

 

Angola plans to reduce GHG emissions up to 35% unconditionally by 2030 as compared to the 
Business  As  Usual  (BAU)  scenario  (base  year  2005).  In  addition,  it  is  expected  that  through  a 
conditional mitigation scenariothe country could reduce an additional 15% below BAU emission 
levels by 2030. In achieving its unconditional and conditional targets Angola expects to reduce its 
emissions  trajectory  by  nearly  50%  below  the  BAU  scenario  by  2030  at  overall  cost  of  over 
14.7billion USD. 
 
Given  to  its  extreme  vulnerability  to  Climate  Change  impacts  in  some  key  economic  sectors, 
Angola‟s  INDC  also  includes  priority  Adaptation  actions  that  will  enable  the  strengthening  of  the 
resilience  of  the  country  towards  the  attainment  of  the  Long  Term  Strategy  for  Development  of 
Angola (2025). 
 
Sectoral Intervention for Adaptation 
 
The Angolan economy has been hit hard by the impact of climate change expressed as prolonged 
drought,  damaging  flash  floods,  forest  fires,  reduced  crop  production,  reduced  water  resources, 
impacted  fishing  resources,  etc.  Many  of  the  economy  sectors  of  Angola  have  been  impacted  by 
climate variability in the last thirty years. However, there are economy sectors which are extremely 
vulnerable  to  impacts  resulting  from  the  extreme  events  and  which  will  pose  not  only  serious 
livelihood  and  direct  health  risks  but  can  also  affect  the  economic  potential  and  national  food 
security.  Therefore  within  the  context  of  this  INDC,  Angola  prioritises  the  implementation  of 
Adaptation measures in the following main sectors: 
 

*  Agriculture 
*  Coastal Zone 
*  Land-Use, Forests, Ecosystems and Biodiversity 
*  Water resources 
*  Health 

 
Angola acknowledges that climate change adaptation requires unconditional as well as conditional 
actions  in  order  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  communities  against  the  expected  Climate  Change 
impacts. The overall cost of implementing both the unconditional and conditional actions amounts to 
around 1billion USDacross sectors up to 2030. 
 
Given  the  time  constraint,  thisreport  on  theINDCcould  not  beexhaustive,  and  it  is  of  adynamic 
natureand thus willbe refinedin the light ofnew data and information. 

 

 

1.  NATIONAL CONTEXT 
 

The Republic of Angola with a size of 1.25m sq km (481,354 sq miles) is located in SW Africa and 
extremely  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts  such  as  drought  and  floods  particularly  in  the 
southern  regions.  Projections  of  mean  annual  rainfall  averaged  over  the  country  from  different 
models indicate a wide range of changes in precipitation for Angola. Furthermore, IPCC scenarios 
(SRES A1B scenario as shown in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report) have projected an increase of 
mean annual temperature in the region by 1.2 to 3.2°C by the 2060s, and 1.7 to 5.1°C by the 2090s. 
Climate  models  predict  that  over  the  next  50  to  100  years,  Angola  will  experience  increased 
temperatures, more extreme weather events, an expansion of arid and semi-arid regions, seasonal 
shifts in rainfall, localized floods, increased wildfires, sea level rise, increased rainfall in the northern 
parts of the country, changes in river flows and changes in sea and lake temperatures. According to 
the Angolan NAPA (2011), the major expected climate change threats and impacts are: floods, soil 
erosion,  drought  episodes,  rise  in  sea-level.  The  main  sectors  identified  as  affected  by  climate 
change are: agriculture and food security; forest and biodiversity; fisheries; water resources; human 
health; infrastructures; coastal zones; energy. 
 
In response to decisions adopted at the 19th and 20th sessions of the Conference of the Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as a demonstration of its 
commitment to take part in the aspiration set at International level to fight against the  phenomenon 
of  climate change, thus contributing to global  efforts to  reduce greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions, 
Angola has embarkedon the process of preparation of its intended determined contributions through 
a  participatory  approach.  This  document 
Intended  Nationally 
Determined Contribution (INDC) which encompasses for Mitigation purposes both unconditional and 
conditional measures for the reduction of GHG. Given to its extreme vulnerability to Climate Change 
impacts in some key economic sectors, Angola‟s INDC also includespriority Adaptation actions that 
will  enable  the  strengthening  of  the  resilience  of  the  country  towards  the  attainment  of  the  Long 
Term Strategy for Development of Angola (2025).

2.  ANGOLA'S MITIGATION CONTRIBUTION 
 
Objectives and expected trajectories for 2030 

Greenhouse gases covered 
The contribution of Angola is based on the estimation of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and 
nitrous  oxide  (N2O)  for  all  economic  sectors.  F-gases  emissions  are  not  counted  as  they  were 
considered negligible across the country. 
 
Sectoral and geographical coverage 
Based on the last GHG inventory, the selected sectors are defined according to the revised IPCC 
Guidelines 1996 and cover the entire territory. 
 
Base year period and baseline data 
The year 2005 is used as the reference year. Data are extracted from the latest national inventory of 
greenhouse gases and from the database of ENERDATA1.  The Global Warming Potential (GWP) 
values used are those determined by the IPCC for the preparation of national emissions inventories 
accordingDecision 4/CMP.7 of the UNFCCC by which from 2013 GWP of CH4 is 25 and not 21, and 
PWG of N2O is 298 and not 310.

ENERDATA, 2015 

 

 
 
For  the  year  2005,  GHG  emissions  amounted  to  66.8  million  tons  of  CO2e,  of  which  over  95% 
stemmed  from  the  fossil  fuel  consumption.  The  baseline  structure  (2005)  of  GHG  emission  of 
Angola by sector shown below indicates the dominance of Energy fuel combustion sector followed 
by  the  Agriculture  and  Change  in  Land-Use  Change  and  Forestry  sectors.  In  addition,  the 
contribution of the fugitive emissions in the energy sector is clearly evident. 
 

 
Baseline structure (2005) of GHG emission of Angola by sector and emissions in the energy sector 

 
Reference scenario without mitigation policies 
The  baseline  scenario  was  developed  with  the  GACMO  model  (Greenhouse  gas  Abatement  Cost 
Model2) based on linear sectoral projections. It is based on the 2005 inventory of GHG emissions. 
This inventory was produced according to the revised guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate  Change  (IPCC)  and  published  in  the  Initial  National  Communication.The  sectoral  linear 
projection estimates the level of GHG emissions without mitigation measures to triple by 2030 from 
the  level  of  emissions  in  2005.  More  than  90%  of  these  emissions  would  come  from  the  Energy 
sector making this the privileged area for the development of mitigation options for Angola. 
 
Contribution level  
Therefore, the country is committed to stabilize its emissions by reducing GHG emissions up to 50% 
below  BAU  emission  levels  by  2030  through  unconditional  and  conditional  actions  targeting  the 
following sectors:  
 

*  Power generation from renewable sources; and  
*  Reforestation.  

 

Unconditional Reduction 
The level of reduction planned unconditionally is expected to be up to 35% by 2030 as compared to 
the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, taking 2005 as the reference year. 
 
Conditional Reduction 
In  a  conditional  mitigation  scenario  Angola  plans  to  reduce  further  its  emissions.  Therefore,  the 
mitigation options identified in this scenario are expected to reduce an additional 15% below BAU 
emission  levels  by  2030.  In  total,  in  achieving  its  unconditional  and  conditional  targets  Angola

expects to reduce its emissions trajectory by nearly 50% below the BAU scenario across sectors by 
2030.

Description 

 
Even  though  Angola  is  an  oil-producing  country,  the  potential  for  renewable 
energy is significant. With the growing energy demand in Angola, this type of 
project  is  seen  as  priority  in  the  Angolan  energy  sector  strategy.  Being  an 
environmentally friendly technology, the renewable-energy projects contribute 
to  sustainable  development  of  the  country  and  will  serve  as  an  example  for 
the  expansion  of  this  technology  locally  and  nationally.  In  addition,  the 
production of renewable energy and the dispatching of the entire production 
to the Angolan electrical system will not only reduce emissions of greenhouse 
gases  (GHGs)  but  also  will  mitigate  local  pollution  caused  by  atmospheric 
emissions  from  burning  fossil  fuel.  On  the  economical  perspective,  the 
projects  will  lead  to  a  reduction  on  demand  from  fossils  fuels,  which  are  a 
very expensive item  within the national economy. Below are identified some 
examples  of  renewable  energy  projects  that  are  being  developed  and/or 
implemented in Angola: 
 
1.  Repowering of Cambambe Central I Hydroelectric Power Plant:  

The  Cambambe  project  activity  is  located  on  the  Municipality  of 
Cambambe,  180  km  east  of  Luanda, 
the  National  Capital.  The 
Municipality  of  Cambambe  is  located  on  the  south  of  the  Kwanza 
Province, which is delimited by the Kwanza River. The proposed project 
comprises  an  expansion  of  the  installed  capacity  to  the  existing 
Cambambe  Hydroelectric  Power  Plant, from  180  MW to  the  current  260 
MW. The project activity reduces emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
by  preventing  the  operation  of  power  plants  that  use  fossil  fuels  as  an 
energy  source.  In  the  absence  of  project  activity,  fossil  fuels  could  be 
burned  in  power  plants  that  are  connected  to  the  grid.  An  ex  ante 
estimative of  emission reductions achieved by the project is of1,529,311 
tCO2e per year. 

 

2.  Cambambe Hydroelectric Second Power Plant: 

The  Cambambe  project  activity  is  located  on  the  Municipality  of 
Cambambe, 180 km east of Luanda, the National Capital. The proposed 
project  comprises  a  capacity  addition  to  the  existing  Cambambe 
Hydroelectric  Power  Plant  with  installation  of  additional  700  MW  of  the 
actual  generation  capacity.  The  project  activity  reduces  emissions  of 
greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  by  preventing  the  operation  of  power  plants 
that  use  fossil  fuels  as  an  energy  source.  In  the  absence  of  project 
activity, fossil fuels burned in power plants that are connected to the grid. 
An  ex  ante  estimative  of  annual  emission  reductions  is  3,282,000tCO2e 
per year. 

 
3.  Tombwa Wind Farm 

The  Tombwa  project  activity  is  located  on  the  Municipality  of  Tombwa, 
Namibe  Province,  1,234  km  east  of  Luanda,  the  National  Capital.  The 
project  activity  consists  of  a  wind  energy  conversion  into  electrical 
energy, providing an alternative source of renewable energy. The energy 
generated will be a result of a total installed capacity of 100 MW and will 
produce power through 50 wind turbines, with a  rated individual potency 
of 2MW. The wind farm has a main objective of generate electricity to the 
interconnected  national  system.  This  energy  will  reduce  the  amount  of 
energy produced by the power plants that runs using fossil fuel, inserting

renewable energy into the system. Thus, helping to reduce emissions of 
greenhouse  gases  and  encourage 
the  use  of  alternative  energy 
technologies. Although the ex-ante estimative of emission reductions are 
low(157,258 tCO2e per year),the implementation of the project will mean 
an  important  contribution  to  achieve  the  government  efforts  to  diversify 
the  energy  matrix,  with  the  input  of  another  source  of  clean  energy  with 
low environmental impact. 

Angola„s climate diversity allows for the cultivation of a great variety of crops. 
The  national  agricultural  potential  of  Angola  is  high  enough  that  the  country 
has  the  ability  to  be  self-sufficient.  Nevertheless,  the  sector  is  characterized 
mostly  by  small  farmers  working  under  subsistence  farming  methods.  The 
surface area used for agriculture amounts to about 26% of the territory. GHG 
emissions  in  agriculture  stem  from  animal  production  and  wild  fires.  The 
objective  is  to  stabilize  GHG  emissions  from  these  sources.  Besides,  the 
country  is  willing  to  develop  the  production  of  ethanol  as  an  alternative  to 
fossil fuels. 
Angola‟s  annual  growth  in  manufacturing  rose  from  6.5%  in  2012  to  8%  in 
2013  and  was  driven  particularly  by  wood,  cement,  and  electric  materials 
production.  In  2005  GHG  emissions  of  the  industry  sector  were  related  to 
activities  such  as  these:  breweries,  cement,  clinker,  pastry,  crackers  and 
cookies,  margarine,  beef,  animal  feed,  glass,  freezer  assembly,  etc.  The 
GHG emissions from Industrial processes are estimated to be very low (less 
than one million tons of CO2e). 
As  regards the resource  base,  natural forest  is the  most  significant  biomass 
resource  in  the  country,  comprising  an  estimated  59  million  hectares 
according to the latest data with current deforestation rates estimated at 0.2% 
per  year.    About  53  million  hectares  of  land  are  considered  to  be  forests  - 
however  of  those  only  2%  are  actually  made  up  of  dense,  humid,  high 
productivity  forests,  that  are  very  rich  in  biodiversity,  47.1%  comprises  of  a 
mosaic  of  forest  and  savannah,  45.4%  is  woodland  (miombo)  and  the 
remaining percentage is occupied by steppe, mangrove and wetlands. Wood 
logging  is  essential  to  the  local  population,  both  economically  and  socially. 
The potential for wood cutting each year is estimated at 333,000 m3 and the 
current rate of cutting is estimated to be 85,000 m3 per year. The calculation 
of  CO2  emissions  and  removals  from  land  use  changes  and  forestry  is 
primarily based on the following main activities: 

-  Forestry conversion; 
-  Use of biomass; 
-  Phase-out of harvested land. 

The  sector  is  thought  to  have  captured  close  to  3  million  tons  of  CO2e  in 
2005, and the country is committed to increase carbon sequestration from the 
forestry sector to 5 million tons of CO2e per year by 2030. 

 
Presentation of conditional mitigation options 

Key  available  projects  that  are  expected  to  maximize  the  amount  of  avoided  emissions,  while 
concurrently  minimizing  the  level  of  required  upfront  investment  have  been  selected  as  potential 
mitigation options to be developed conditionally.These mitigation options identified in this scenario 
are  expected  to  reduce  an  additional  15%  below  BAU  emission  levels  by  2030.  By  undertaking

these actions Angola will achieve the potential conditional target of 50 % emissions reductionbelow 
BAU emission levels by 2030.For this, the Government of Angola will pursue international support to 
utilize existing and emerging climate finance mechanisms and will encourage investments in green 
growth development initiatives. These projects are briefly described below and several of them are 
already on the agenda or subjected to feasibility assessments. 
 
The total funds required for the implementation of these projects are roughly about 14.7billion USD 
to reach the mitigation target.  

The power sector:As part of the project"Mapping of the Winds and Solar of Angola" (Implementing 
Angolan Ministry: Ministry of Energy and Water. National Directorate of Renewable Energy), which 
aimed at identifying the most suitable sites for the development of endogenous energy resources,a 
potential of 8,491MW of renewable sources were identified 

*  681 MW for wind energy projects,  

*  438 MW for solar projects,  

*  640 MW for biomass projects, and  

*  6,732 MW hydroelectric projects 

With an investment of 11,346 million USD. 

Considering that Angola installed generating capacity was 2,388 MW in the first semester of 2015, 
of  which  41.7%  is  hydroelectric  and  58.3%  diesel-generated,  and  that  less  than  20%  of  Angola's 
population  has  access  to  electricity,  with  most  depending  on  wood  or  charcoal,  the  objective  is  to 
promote access to renewable energy. The table presents the list of renewable energy projects to be 
considered  under  a  conditional  contribution  by  the  Angola  to  the  international  climate  regime.This 
projects  are  in  the  early  stages  of  feasibility  assessment.  Developing  this  portfolio  of  renewable 
power  projects  will  stabilize  the  CO2  emissions  by  2030  from  the  power  sector,  as  these  projects 
enable  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  increasing  demand.  Considering  an  investment  of  1,138 
US$/kW  for  a  large-scale  hydropower  connected  to  main  grid,  4,500US$/kW  for  a  small-scale 
hydropower  connected  to  main  grid,  1300US$/kW  forwind  turbines  connected  to  main  grid  (on-
shore) (GACMO), 3,396US$/kW for biomass projectsand 1,500 US$/kW for PV solar.

1. 
The use of biomass as energy source: In Angola about 80% of the population, depend on 
biomass for their everyday energy purposes, i.e. water heating, cooking and lighting the majority of 
which are living in rural areas and utilizing biomass as firewood. The demand for wood for charcoal 
is, therefore,  also a significant driver of forest degradation and, subsequently, the release of GHG 
emissions. Biomass consumption (wood-energy and agricultural residues) remains the main source 
of domestic energy, and energy in small-scale commercial sectors. This intense cutting of trees to 
produce  and  supply  charcoal  to  the  urban  and  periurban  areas  is  putting  an  extreme  pressure  on 
the  local  resources.  Two-thirds  of  the  population  in  Luanda  are  living  in  periurban  areas,  and 
approximately  270,000  tons  of  charcoal  are  utilized  in  the  capital  city  annually.  Reducing  the 
demand for firewood  is,  therefore,  an  important strategy  to  reduce  drivers  of  deforestation  and  an 
exhaustion of Angola‟s natural resources. Considering that about 1 million tons of charcoal may be 
used  annually  in  the  country,  the  potential  emission  reduction  from  the  production  of  charcoal  is 
estimated  at  more  than  750,000  tCO2/year  and  at  approximate  cost  of  around  300  million 
USD4.  
 
2. 
The agriculture sector: In addition to efforts to mitigate GHG emissions from the agriculture 
sector,  the  country  intends  to  promote  the  use  of  biofuels,  by  producing  ethanol  and  sugar,  using 
the  experience  from  Brazil.  The  objective  is  to  cultivate  and  harvest  34  thousand  hectares  of 
sugarcane in the province of Malange, to process a capacity of 2.25 million tons of raw material per 
season. The country intends to produce 23 million liters of ethanol and 170 GW of power through 
co-generation by 2019. The budget is between 540 million and 1 billion USD. 
 
3. 
The Forest Carbon Options: Angola possesses significant opportunities for initiating large-
scale  afforestation/reforestation  activities,  which  hold  several  economic,  social  and  environmental 
advantages  while  alleviating  the  pressure  on  natural  forests.  Afforestation  and  Reforestation  of 
degraded  forest  lands  and  mangrove  habitats  have  a  strong  potential  for  mitigation  purposes. 
Angola is currently undertaking legislative reforms in the forestry sector, while FAO is assisting the 
Government  of  Angola  in  carrying  out  a  national  forestry  assessment  with  the  aim  of  producing 
comprehensive  information on the state of forests in the country.  Several large scale afforestation 
initiatives  are  currently  being  planned  which  includes  50  000ha  to  be  planted  in  the  10  years; 
140 000ha  of  eucalyptus  to  be  planted  in  Huila  province;  60  000ha  of  eucalyptus  to  be  planted  in 
the Province of Kuando-Cubango and 25 000ha about to be planted in Malange province in the next 
five years. Considering that the current cost of planting 1000 ha = 6 250 000 USD the approximate 
cost of these afforestation initiatives will amount around 2 billion USD.  

 
4. 
Presently,  the  potential  income  from  REDD+  projects  in  the  country  is  considered  to  be 
substantial.  Calculating  the  potential  emission  reductions  from  REDD+  activities  in  Angola 
demonstrates that there is mitigation potential if deforestation is avoided completely. Assuming that 

                                                           
4 http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5555e/x5555e08.htm 

 

the  baseline  is  entirely  based  on  historical  emissions,  avoided  emissions  are  calculated  by 
multiplying  the  annual  deforestation  in  Angola,  estimated  to  be  124,800  ha  per  year  (based  on 
numbers  from  the  period  1990-2010),  by  82  tC/ha,  which  is  the  approximate  amount  of  tons  of 
carbon  stored  per  ha  in  the  country‟s  forests.  Avoiding  deforestation,  alone,  in  Angola  has  the 
potential to contribute to more than 35 million tons in CO2 emission reductions every year. The 
budget required is above 500 million USD. 
 

The Republic of Angola recognizes the roll that Carbon Market can play for the mobilization of 
resources and promotion of the development and transfers of climate friendly technology. 

 

 

 

 

3.  ANGOLA'S ADAPTATION CONTRIBUTION 
 

This  Adaptation  Intended  Contribution  is  included  for  the  purposes  of  Information  of  other  Parties 
and the Public that this is part of the country‟s intended climate actions, and it does not constitute 
international obligations of the country. 
 
The Angolan economy has been hit hard by the impact of climate change expressed as prolonged 
drought,  damaging  flash  floods,  forest  fires,  reduced  crop  production,  reduced  water  resources, 
impacted  fishing  resources,  etc.  Many  of  the  economy  sectors  of  Angola  have  been  impacted  by 
climate variability in the last thirty years, namely the Agriculture, Coastal Zone, Land-Use, Forests, 
Ecosystems andBiodiversity, Water resources, Health. However, there are economy sectors which 
are extremely vulnerable to impacts resulting from the extreme events and which will pose not only 
serious  livelihood  and  direct  health  risks  but  can  also  affect  the  economic  potential  and  national 
food  security.  The  need  for  adaptation  seems  thus  obvious.  The  vulnerability  increases  for  higher 
temperature increases, so adaptation needs will depend on the expected temperature rise. 
 
The  Republic  of  Angola  ratified  the  UNFCCC  in  2000  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  2007.  Angola 
completed its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2011. In 2012 Angola submitted 
its Initial National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCC). Among the priorities identified in the NAPA, two policy measures are noteworthy: revise 
sectoral laws for proactive adaptation; national institutional mechanism for adaptation planning and 
mainstreaming.  Accordingly,  Angola  has  developed  in  recent  years  various  national  plans  and 
strategies which include activities relevant to climate change, including the:  
 

*  National Strategy for Climate Change (2008); 
*  National Afforestation and Reforestation Strategy (2010);  
*  Strategic Plan of Disaster Risk Management (2011);  
*  National Action Programme to fight Desertification (2014);  

 
and,  above  all,  the  Strategy  of  Long-term  Development  for  Angola  (2025).  Many  of  the  actions 
envisaged  in  these  plans  and  strategies,  particularly  in  the  energy  sector,  are  linked  to  both 
adaptation and mitigation. 
 
Objectives and Sectoral Intervention for Adaptation 

Within the context of this INDC, Angola prioritises the implementation of Adaptation measures in the 
following main sectors: 
 
1. Agriculture 
2. Coastal Zone 
3. Land-Use, Forests, Ecosystems and Biodiversity 
4. Water resources 
5. Health 
 
Presentation of Unconditional Adaptation options 
 
Angola acknowledges that climate change adaptation requires unconditional as well as conditional 
actions  in  order  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  communities  against  the  expected  Climate  Change 
impacts. The unconditional actions (current) are listed below and its implementation costs amounts 
to around 500 million USD at current price.

4.  FAIRNESS AND AMBITION 
 
Angola  is  extremely  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  Climate  Change  and  some  specific  regions  of 
Angola such as the southern regions are already experiencing a regular worsening of droughts and 
floods, as well as costal degradation and regional and national-level adaptation action plans are in 
place to address those sectors which have been particularly affected. The estimated global warming 
of  2°C  would  imply  for  Angola  severe  economic  losses  for  Agriculture  sector,  a  sector  that 
contributes  to  over  8%  of  the  country  GDP  and  at  threat  to  the  stability  of  food  security.  The 
Government of Angola has been diverting own funds to carry out implementation of complementary 
initiatives addressing these Climate Change impacts. 
 
In addition,  Angola is the third-largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa and a net exporter of fossil 
fuels, and by now the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria. According to 
the  country‟s  Initial  National  Communication  (INC)  report  to  the  United  Nations  Framework 
Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  released  in  2012  (but  based  on  emission  inventory 
statistics  from  2005)  Angola  only  contributed  approximately  with  66.8  million  tons  of  CO2e  of 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions to the atmosphere. This contribution is meagre and represents a small 
percentage  of  current  global  GHG  emissions.  However,  though  showing  an  insignificant 
contribution,  at  0.1%  of  the  total  global  emissions,  while  the  per-capita  emissions  are  4.15 
tons of CO2e in 20055compared to the global average6.Angola recognises that in order to meet 
the  2  degree  objective  all  countries  will  need  to  undertake  mitigation  measures.  In  fact  the 
Government  of  Angola  has  enacted  a  considerable  amount  of  Laws  and  Policies  as  well  has 
developed  important  sectoral  studies  which  gives  an  idea  of  how  determined  the  Government 
Authorities  are  to  take  the  country  to  the  forefront  of  African  countries  reducing  their  GHG 
emissions.Angola‟s approach focuses on avoiding an increase of  emissions per capita beyond the 
current  level,  while  pursuing  its  development  goals.Through  this  INDC  Angola  is  determined  to 
reduce its emissions trajectory by nearly 50% below the BAU scenario by 2030. In selecting the 
actions outlined above, Angola has prioritised those which fit with the growth priorities set out in its 
national development plans in particular the Angola 2025 Policy Document. In addition, Angola has 
captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation, not only by prioritising those adaptation 
activities with significant mitigation co-benefits but also by seeking to minimise the carbon footprint 
of its adaptation portfolio as a whole. Angola is therefore putting forward Mitigation actions as well 
as Adaptation measures with mitigation benefits amounting over  15,7 billion USDthat align with a 
low  carbon  development  pathway,  which  to  be  fully  implemented  would  require  additional 
international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building. 
 
 

5.  MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
 
Angola‟s  contribution  will  be  implemented  following  the  Government  strategy  set  of  pursuing  the 
enforcement/execution  of  the  already  enacted  laws  and  policiesso  to  reduce  the  gap  between  the 
recent  vigorous  legislative  activity  and  the  real  implementation  of  mitigation  measures.  Within  this 
framework  Angola  has  already  engaged  with  Clean  Development  Mechanism  by  submitting  a 
number  of  important  large scale  projects.  This action  will  be  complemented  by  the  continuation  of 
climate change mitigation/adaptation mainstreaming into the National Plans and Policies as well as 
the  implementation  of  the  National  Strategy  for  the  Implementation  of  UNFCCC  and  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.  This  framework  comprises:  generating  reports  and  inventories  about  GHG  emissions  in

Angola and their impact on the environment and public health; producing programmes and projects 
with measures to mitigate climate change; developing technical and professional training actions in 
areas  related  to  climate  change;  fostering  international  co-operation  within  the  context  of  climate 
change, particularly in terms of transfer of knowledge, experience and technology. Therefore,Angola 
will  address  the  clear  shortness  of  human  and  technical  capacity  to  keep  abreast  with  the  real 
situation of GHG emissions in the various sectors for which Angola will require support to implement 
capacity building and training at various level and sectors. 
 
The  overall  preliminary  cost  of  implementing the  proposed  Mitigation  and  Adaptation  contributions 
amount  to  over  15.7  billion  USD  across  sectors  up  to  2030.  Some  of  this  amount  has  already 
been  provided  by  the  Government  of  Angola  within  the  Unconditional  Mitigation  and  Adaptation 
scenario.  Therefore, 
the  Conditional  mitigation  and  adaptation 
contributions  that  the  country  endeavour  to  deliver  will  require  international  support  in  form  of 
finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building to fully accomplish 
the intended contributions.

6.  SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS 
 
 
The accomplishment of the mitigation and adaptation contributions being proposed in the Angolan 
INDC  will  undoubtedly  bring  important  benefit  for  the  wider  communities  and  to  the  rural 
communities in particular, namely: 

-  The climate resilience program includes increasing hydropower plants and other renewable 
energy sources to provide electricity to rural communities and businesses,  replacing diesel 
fuelled off grid generation.  

-  The  implementation  of  the  proposed  contribution  carries  a  huge  potential  of  youth  job 
creation in the country either through the local manufacturing/assembly of renewable energy 
machines/parts  or through the forestation  and  afforestation  programmes  which  demand for 
labour will be certainly a source of employment for the rural communities. 

-  The eventual support provided by the international community to Angola will strengthen the 
technical capacity of the country‟s human resources through assisted training and capacity 
building programmes. 

-  Finally, overall, both the mitigation and the adaptation actions offered as contribution in the 
Angolan  INDC  will  certainly  enhance  the  adaptive  capacity  of  the  rural  population  and 
consequently augmenting their resilience to climate change impacts. 

 

7.  GENDER PERSPECTIVE 

 

The  underlining  policies  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  INDC  mitigation  and  adaptation 
contributions  and  the  actions  to  be  implemented  in  this  context  include  cross-cutting  issues  which 
are  gender  sensitive  and  therefore  will  take  into  account  women  as  important  decision  makers 
regarding  energy  consumption  in  particular.  Systematically,  mitigation  and  adaptation  measures 
offered  in  the  Angolan  INDC  emphasize  the  importance  of  their  implementation  avoiding 
exacerbation  of  the  impacts  of  climate  change  that  already  have  disproportionate  adverse  effects 
based  solely  on  gender,  in  particular  in  the  agriculture,  water  resources  and  biomass  energy 
sectors.

Climate Change continues to pose irreversible threat to the people of Tonga, its society, livelihoods, and 
its  national  environment. The  interference  to the climate  system  from  human-caused  climate  change  is 
already  affecting  Tonga's  development,  livelihood  of  its  people  and  future.  The  World  Risk  Report  has 
ranked Tonga as one of the world most at-risk country for natural hazards, and sea level rising. 

Tonga makes a negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, with low per capita emissions 
of 2.95 tCO2e whilst notably; the increasing frequency of strong destructive tropical cyclones has affected 
Tonga's  development  with  damages  on  average  costing  20  percent  of  GDP.   Extensive  coastal  erosions 
across  the  Kingdom  has  prompted  Government  to  direct  over  30  percent  of  mobilized  development 
assistance  to  address  it  during  the  last  six  years,  and  lack  of  climate  proofing  investments  further  risks 
Government's poverty alleviation commitments and national development.  

Irreversible  loss  and  damage  from  extreme  weather  events  and  coastal  erosions  are  critical  areas 
whereby national response are limited influencing the designed national contributions through reducing 
emission and also on creative smart resilience investments.  

Taking  into  account  its  negligible  emission  and  limited  capability,  Tonga's  intended  contributions  are 
designed to be quantified at the national level cascaded to the sector level as follows: 

·     50%  of  electricity  generation  from  renewable  sources  by  2020.  In  2015  renewable  energy 
accounts  for  approximately  9%  of  total  electricity  generation,  with  confirmed  and  funded 
investments taking this to 13% in 2016.  

·       70% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030 

·        Improve  Energy  efficiency  through  reduction  of  electricity  line  losses  to  9  percent  by  2020 

(from a baseline of 18 percent in 2010) 

·       To double the 2015 number of Marine Protected Areas by 2030 

·        Sector  Emission  Reduction  Targets:  Transport,  Agriculture,  Environment  Friendly  Waste 

Management and Reforestation 

·        Other  Sectors  Climate  Resilience:  Public  Infrastructures,  foreshore  protection,  buildings  and 

houses. 

INDC is designed for both reduced emission and increased investing in climate resilience, Tonga makes an 
explicit  call  for  a  more  cost-effective  national  response  and  avoids  the  much  bigger  costs  caused  by 
climate  inaction.  To  facilitate  this  high  level  commitment,  Government  has  raised  climate  change  to 
Ministerial  level,  establishment  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  Standing  Committee  for  Climate  Change, 
developing  of  National  Climate  Change  Policy,  revision  of  the  Joint  National  Action  Plan  to  Integrate 
Climate  Change  and  Disaster  Risk  Reduction,  and  development  of  the  third  Climate  Change  National 
Communication. 
Tonga's INDC will also require basic information and data so that they can be understood clearly by key 
stakeholders  to  achieve  consensus  in  setting  realistic  emission  reduction  targets  and  smart  resilience 
investments.  The 
include  adaptation,  mitigation  and  means  of 
implementation:  TSDF  national  planning  framework  with  its  national  goal  to  achieve  a  more  inclusive, 
sustainable  and  effective  land  administration,  environment  management,  and  resilience  to  climate  and 
risk, finance initiatives and capacity building. 

intended  contribution  also 

Overall, Tonga's INDCs should raise the Kingdom ambition to contribute towards a robust and ambitious 
legally binding COP21 climate change agreement.

Section 1: Introduction 

This island Kingdom of Tonga is located in the Central South Pacific. It lies between 15° and 23° 30' South 
and  173°  and  177°  West.  Tonga  consists  of  four  clusters  of  islands  extended  over  a  north-south  axis: 
Tongatapu (260sqkm) and ‘Eua (87sqkm) in the south, Ha'apai (109sqkm) in the middle, Vava'u (121sqkm) 
in the north and Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu (72sqkm) in the far north. Nuku'alofa, the capital is situated 
in Tongatapu, the largest island. 
 
Tonga's  archipelago  is  situated  within  200km  of  the  subduction  zone  of  the  Indian-  Australian  and  the 
Pacific tectonic plates which is part of  the Pacific Ring of Fire where intense seismic activities occur  and a 
potential  source  of  tsunami.  Most  of  its  atoll  islands  including  the  main  island  are  very  flat  with  an 
average altitude of 2-5 meters and hence Tonga is highly vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surges and 
tsunami inundation. 
 
In  June  2012,  the  population  of  Tonga  was  estimated  at  103,219  which  is  five  times  higher  than  1901, 
with most of this growth existed between the 1930s and 1970s. Tongatapu is the most populous island 
and has the highest population density. Increased population, along with urbanisation and development 
has resulted in substantial pressure on, and degradation of, land and marine resources. This in turn has 
reduced  the  resilience  of  Tonga's  environment  and  its  people  to  climate  change  impacts  and  disaster 
risks. 
 
Since June 2013, Tonga moved from a lower middle to upper middle-income bracket, with a nominal GDP 
per  capita  for  2013/14  of  about  $7,636  or  about  US$3,800.  Because  of  Tonga's  large  receipts  of 
remittances,  running  at  over  20%  of  GDP,  Gross  National  Income  (GNI)  per  capita  (about  US$4,500  in 
2013) is a better measure of the actual income going to Tongans. Since 2005 Tonga's GNI per capita has 
grown considerably faster than the average for the region, increasing from about the same as the regional 
average  to 35  percent  greater.  However,  these  figures  are  average  figures  for Tonga  and  do  not  give a 
clear  indication of  distribution or  inequality.  The  latest  Household  Income  Expenditure  Survey  (HIES)  of 
2009 indicates an increase in the percentage of the population living below the poverty line increasing to 
22.5 percent compared to 16.2 percent in the 2001 HIES. The increase was greatest on the outer islands 
increasing from 11.8 to 22.9 percent. 
 
The current anthropogenic greenhouse gases and warming of the atmosphere have negatively impacted 
Tonga's environment, its people and their livelihoods.  The most recent report from the Pacific-Australia 
Climate  Change  Science  and  Adaptation  Planning  Program  (PACCSAP)  provided  the  following  future 
projections to 2100 for Tonga: 

1.  El Niño and La Niña events will continue to occur in the future (very high confidence), but there is 

2. 

little consensus on whether these events will change in intensity or frequency; 
It  is  not  clear  whether  mean  annual  rainfall  will  increase  or  decrease  and  the  model  average 
indicates  little  change  (low  confidence  in  this  model  average),  with  more  extreme  rain  events 
(high confidence);  

3.  Drought frequency is projected to decrease slightly (low confidence);  
4.  Ocean acidification is expected to continue (very high confidence);  
5.  The risk of coral bleaching will increase in the future (very high confidence);  
6.  Sea level will continue to rise (very high confidence). 

 
Recent climate and weather events in Tonga, particularly in Ha'apai ( a sequence of drought, Cyclone Ian, 
and  further drought), are a window  to a future that will increasingly  involve multiple stresses from the 
above  (1-6)  along  with  the  pre-existing  environmental,  social,  and  economic  stresses.  Building  greater 
resilience to existing extreme natural events and the threat of climate change is essential to ensure the 
sustainable progress that is  desired. These and other potential threats require Tonga  to become  better 
equipped  to  plan  and  respond  o  the  unexpected.  This  requires  considerable  foresight  in  planning  and 
improved monitoring and evaluation of progress.

Section 2: National Response 
The  INDC  recognises  that  Climate  Change  is  the  single  biggest  issue  that  will  determine  the  future  of 
Tonga over the coming decades and will require a ‘whole of Tonga' level of cooperation and coordination. 
 
The  Tongan  Strategic  Development  Framework  2015-2025:  A  more  progressive  Tonga:  Enhancing  Our 
Inheritance (TSDF 2015-2025), presents the country's new development framework. TSDF sets one of its 
seven  Goal  to  commit  the  Kingdom  to  ‘a  more  inclusive,  sustainable  and  effective  land  administration, 
environment management, and resilience to climate and risk' and identifies the high level societal results 
required to improve the quality of life of Tongan citizens which include inter alia: 
 
1. 

Informing all national stakeholders and development partners of the broad Organisational  Outcomes 
that are needed to support the country's  National Outcomes and Impact;  

2.  Guides  the  formulation  of  sector  plans,  MDA  corporate  plans  and  the  medium  term  budgetary 

framework (MTBF) through which resources are allocated;  

3.  Guides the development of Government external economic relations and the country strategies and 

assistance programs of development partners;  

4.  Provides indicators, with targets, to facilitate monitoring and measurement our high level progress.  
 
The TSDF 2015-2025 is designed to achieve the desired national impact of a "A more progressive Tonga 
supporting  a  higher  quality  of  life  for  all."    The  achievement  of  this  is  supported  by  seven  National 
Outcomes: 

A. a more inclusive, sustainable and dynamic knowledge-based economy  

B. a more inclusive, sustainable and balanced urban and rural development across island groups  

C. a more inclusive, sustainable and empowering human development with gender equality  

D. a more inclusive, sustainable and responsive good-governance with law and order  

E.  a  more  inclusive,  sustainable  and  successful  provision  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  and 
technology  

F.  a  more  inclusive,  sustainable  and  effective  land  administration,  environment  management,  and 
resilience to climate and risk  

G. a more inclusive, sustainable and consistent advancement of our external interests, security and 
sovereignty 
 

While resilience to climate and risk is an explicit component of Outcome F it is essentially a cross-cutting 
issue that is of relevance to all seven National Outcomes. In  support  of  the  TSDF  t h e   I N D C   response 
to support Tonga's nationally determined contributions are approached in two national process and two 
contributing clusters: 

1. 

National Process; 

a.  Political and national drivers: strong national political leadership led by Government with 

cascaded governance reporting to Cabinet and to a Parliament Standing Committee required and 
supported by strong governance and national implementation 

b.  Sectoral and technical drivers: provide the national process to facilitate bottom-up engagement of 

sectors, private sector and economy wide process to identify and analyse options required for 
reduced emission.  It is important for this driver to ensure sufficient time is needed for 
establishing emissions pathways by sectors.

Section 3: Approach to Building Resilience to Climate Change 

Within the national response context adopting the TSDF 2015-2025 the framework for building resilience 
to climate change in Tonga will use the new Climate Change Policy (2015-2020).  

The purpose of the new Tonga Climate Change Policy is to provide a clear vision, goal, and objectives to 
direct responses to climate change and disaster risk reduction over the next five years. The policy, and the 
associated, soon to be revised, Joint National Action Plan for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk 
Management (JNAP).   The  Climate  Change  Policy  is not  intended  to  replace  or  duplicate  sector  specific 
policies and plans. Rather, it is intended to provide an overarching context and guiding framework with 
policy objectives that for the most part will require multi-sectoral coordination.  

The overall focus is towards the goal of ‘A Resilient Tonga', aimed at achieving outcomes that are realised 
more  widely  than  can  be  achieved  through  a  more  conventional,  compartmentalised  approach.  Rather 
than address climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction in a fragmented manner, a 
holistic approach is taken to build resilience.  There are five action areas: 

1.  Mainstreaming  for  a  Resilient  Tonga  -  To  fully  mainstream  the  goal  of  a  Resilient  Tonga  into 

government legislation, policies, and planning at all levels; 

2.  Research,  Monitoring,  Management  of  Data,  and  Information  -  To  implement  a  coordinated 
approach to the collection, monitoring, management and use of all relevant data and information; 
and to develop a coordinated, multi-sectoral approach to research for building a Resilient Tonga; 

3.  Resilience  Building  Response  Capability  -  To  develop  the  capability  for  resilience  building 

responses throughout government, the private sector, and civil society; 

4.  Resilience  Building  Actions  -  To  implement  actions  that  are  designed  towards the  building  of  a 

Resilient Tonga by 2035 at national, island, and community level; 

5.  Finance  -  To  implement  actions that  are  designed towards the  building  of  a  Resilient  Tonga  by 

2035 at national, island, and community level.

Integral to the policy is the planning process which links national, island, and community planning (under 
Objective 1: Mainstreaming) with action (under Objective 4: Resilience Building Actions). 
 
The mechanism for implementation will be through a new Joint National Action Plan for Climate Change 
Adaptation  and  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  (JNAP),  along  with  all  other  plans  (at  sector,  island,  and 
community  level)  that  are  fully  aligned  with  the  goal  and  targets  of  the  policy.  The  new  JNAP,  to  be 
finalised by mid-2016 at the latest, will be fully aligned with the climate change policy objectives. Specific 
activities  will  be  identified,  with  measureable  indicators  to  align  with  the  TSDF  2015-2025,  and  also  be 
fully  costed.  This  will  be  indeed  crucial  for  negotiating  and  securing  of  funding  from      donors  for 
implementation of this plan. 

The  achievement  of  the  climate  change  policy  objectives  will      be  heavily  reliant  on  donor  support  to 
develop  or  revise  policies  for  all  relevant  sectors  to  ensure  full  alignment  with  the  goal  of  a  Resilient 
Tonga.  

A new climate change policy and JNAP with further identified costed activities  will be prepared  by 2020. 
Funding to implement this policy and plan will be strongly dependent on donors support. 

Section 4: Sector Policies and Plans 
Annex  1  provides  an  outline  of  the  sector  legislation,  policies,  and  plans  aligned  with  the  goal  of  a 
Resilient Tonga. Focusing on sector policies and plans in particular it is clear that there are significant gaps 
that need to be addressed.  Climate resilience is addressed as a cross-cutting issue with both adaptation 
and mitigation benefits whereby key resilience building statements cover: 

1.  Halting deforestation and degradation of indigenous forests; 
2.  Maintaining national parks, reserves and protected areas; 
3.  Establishing and managing forest reserves; 
4.  Promoting reforestation and rehabilitation of cleared and degraded forests with climate change 

resilient, and ecologically and socially appropriate tree species; 

5.  Promoting integrated agroforestry in areas earmarked for agriculture; 
6.  Discouraging tree removal on tax allotments; 
7.  Encouraging tax allotment holders to plant and manage trees on their properties. 

In  addition  the  importance  of  trees  for  protection  of  coastal  areas  is  identified.  All  of  the  above  are 
important  adaptation  measures  which  will  provide  significant  mitigation  co-benefits.  The  latter  are 
discussed more fully in the mitigation section. 

 
There are also significant gaps with sector plans. Aside from the current, and soon to be revised, JNAP the 
most  important  recent  plan  is  the  Tonga  Agriculture  Sector  Plan  (TASP).  The  goal  of  the  TASP  is  to 
"increase  and  sustain  resilient  agriculture  livelihoods".  There  are  four  strategic  objectives  aimed  at 
meeting this goal: 

8 

1.  To develop a climate resilient environment; 
2.  To improve the enabling environment; 
3.  To develop diverse, resilient farming systems for the Kingdom's islands; 
4.  To increase and sustain rural incomes across the Kingdom. 

The TASP recognises the importance of,  and includes strategies to support, climate-resilient agricultural 
production  systems  which  are  driven  by  healthy  soils,  secure  and  sustainable  water  supplies,  diverse 
farming  systems,  and  adaptive  rural  communities.  The  TASP  contains  fully  costed  programmes  and 
activities  covering  a  five  year  timeframe,  and  includes  a  results  framework  which  includes  specific 
indicators and targets. 

Section 5: Mitigation context 
Tonga, like other SIDS, makes a negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, with low per 
capita emissions of 2.95    tCO2e, and total emissions of  300.54Gg CO2e (2006 data). When land use  and 
forestry  is  taken  into  account,  Tonga  is  a  net  carbon  sink,  with  its  forests  absorbing  substantially  more 
greenhouse gas emissions than is emitted through all other sources. Nonetheless, as a country with much 
at stake in regard to climate change and variability and natural hazards, Tonga is strongly committed to 
climate change mitigation. Its primary focus on poverty alleviation and climate resilient development has 
many co-benefits in the area of mitigation.  

The  sectoral  breakdown  in  Figure  1  shows  the  energy  sector,  with  transport  (primarily  land  based 
transport) then electricity generation as the highest sources of emissions, followed by the agriculture and 
waste sectors.  

Figure 1: Breakdown of Tonga's GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF) (2006 GHG Inventory)

Within land use change and forestry, forest and grassland conversion of biomass represents a source of 
slightly  larger  magnitude  than  energy  industries  and  transport  combined.  However  this  is  offset  by 
removals from forests, making Tonga a net carbon sink overall, in the order of 1691.97 Gg CO2e. 

 

 
Thus the reduction of emissions from the energy sector, and the maintenance of Tonga's forest resources 
and preservation of forest ecosystem services for a climate resilient future should be the primary focus of 
mitigation actions into the future.

Energy: Electricity Generation 

The dominance of energy as a GHG emitting sector underscores Tonga's current reliance on imported oil 
for its development needs, which supplies all transport fuel, much of the energy for water pumping, and 
over 90% of grid-supplied electricity. As a consequence, the Tongan economy and electricity consumers in 
particular have been exposed to high and volatile electricity prices linked to oil prices over the last fifteen 
years.  This  is  more  acute  than  some  other  larger  Pacific  Island  countries,  as  Tonga  does  not  have 
hydropower potential. 

Energy  is  a  fundamental  building  block  for the Kingdom  in  its  social  and  economic  development  and  in 
enhancing  the  livelihood  and  wellbeing  of  all  Tongans.  Accessible  and  affordable  electricity  that  is 
environmentally  responsible  and  commercially  viable  is  considered  a  key  catalyst  for  sustainable 
economic  growth.  Further,  accessible,  affordable  and  sustainable  electricity  is  crucial  to  achieve  the 
Government's primary target of ‘poverty alleviation' including increasing access to electricity from 89 to 
100%. Increased access to electricity, along with additional growth in commercial and residential demand 
was forecast in 2010 to lead to a 50% increase in electricity consumption by 2020 in the absence of action 
on renewable energy and energy efficiency.  

This reliance on oil imports is incompatible with the aspirational goal of the Tonga Climate Change Policy, 
to achieve a resilient Tonga by 2035. Recognising the issue as a matter of national significance, in 2010 
the Tongan Government released the Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM) 2010-2020 a "ten year road map to 
reduce  Tonga's vulnerability  to oil  price  shocks  and  to  achieve  an  increase  in  quality  access  to modern 
energy services in an environmentally sustainable manner".  

Under the Roadmap, Tonga's initial target was to supply 50% of electricity generation through renewable 
resources by 2020. Furthermore, reducing the level of electricity network losses to reach at most 10% of  
total  electricity  generation  in  the  country.  While  the  targets  was  ambitious,  it  represented  a  clear 
direction and indication from the Government that reducing the vulnerability of the country to future oil 
price shocks is a key objective, and that renewable energy is expected to be a major element of a strategy 
to  enhance  energy  security  and  reduce  climate  change  for  the  Kingdom.    There  is  already  a  plan  to 
increase  from  50%  to  100%    of  RE  in    total  electricity  production  by  2030.  The  Government  has  been 
proactively working towards the RE target, with over a million litres of diesel fuel oil projected to be saved 
per  annum  from  March  2015.  The  Government  also  aims  to  replace  all  diesel-based  water  pumping 
engines by 2017 using solar power.  

Implementation of the Tonga Energy Road Map will help Tonga to achieve its energy strategic objectives 
of accessible to affordable energy prices, improve accessible to clean energy and reliable power supply. 
That will lead to increased economic growth, which improve quality of life for all Tongans. 

Energy: Transport 

While  transport  fuel  (primarily  for  land  transport)  is  the  largest  component  of  energy  sector  emissions 
and  the  biggest  driver  of  oil  imports,  it  is  not  currently  covered  by  the  Roadmap.  Due  to  the  lack  of 
available technological solutions for the transport sector and limited national focus on this area to date, 
the ability to quantify the mitigation potential or cost associated with the transport sector opportunities is 
limited. However, the Government of Tonga is in the process of developing transport sector measures to 
include  in  the  TERM  strategies,  and  has  undertaken  training  and  public  awareness  actions  on  vehicle 
maintenance,  public  transport  and  bicycle  usage.  The  Kingdom  is  particularly  interested  in  biofuels  for 
both transport and electricity generation, developed in alignment with Tonga's resilience focus, ensuring 
sustainable  production  and  replanting.  Tonga  is  participating  in  regional  transport  sector  mitigation 

 
efforts  being  developed  by  the  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community,  and  welcomes  international 
assistance in the development of meaningful and wide ranging mitigation opportunities to reduce Tonga's 
oil dependence and GHG emissions in this sector. This is crucial for a resilient Tonga, especially the plan to 
include diesel engines efficiency  services training to help reduce fossil fuel consumption in the country.  
Furthermore,  the  identified  private  sector  interest  on  solar  car  public  transport  campaign  for  tourists 
would  help  add  values  to  reducing  petroleum  consumption  in  the  sector.      Refer  to  transport  actions 
included in Annex 2.  

10 

Land Use Change and Forestry  

As  identified  in  Section  4,  the  National  Forest  Policy  (2010)  is  of  particular  importance  in  terms  of 
adaptation  and  mitigation  co-benefits.  A  suite  of  activities  regarding  forest  preservation,  forest 
management and regulation are planned, in alignment with Tonga's resilient development strategy. These 
will form part of an unquantified mitigation contribution, as mentioned in Section 6.   

Agriculture 

Emissions  in  the  agriculture  sector  are  principally  a  function  of  livestock  numbers.  Some  mitigation  co-
benefits may  result  from plans  to  enhance  the  climate  resilience  of  the  agriculture  sector  (e.g. through 
improved soil management practices, development of agro-forestry systems, and increased use of biogas 
systems  that  also  provide  organic  fertilizers).   Additionally, improvements  in  animal  welfare  through 
greater water availability to stock and improvements in feed quality could likely lead to reduced methane 
emissions.

Emissions  reduction  benefits  of  these  activities  have  not  yet  been  estimated; 
however  additional  emissions  reductions  delivered  through  these  activities  may 
be substituted for electricity sector contributions. 

Data sources and methods  Estimates  of  GHG  emissions  are  based  on  methodologies  used  in  3rd  GHG 
Inventory,  and  Draft  Third  National  Communication  (both  in  development,  using 
2006 data) and IPCC 2006 Guidelines.

for  electricity  generation 

In 2006 electricity generation contributed 40 Gg CO2e as an emissions source.  
The Tonga Energy Roadmap Business as Usual forecast predicts a 35% increase in 
diesel  consumption 
from  2006-2020,  assuming 
continued economic and population growth, increasing electricity access to 100%, 
and no GHG abatement measures. 
A 50% renewable energy contribution in 2020 would equate to a reduction of 9.4 
million litres of diesel per annum, or approximately 27 Gg CO2e.

Planning Processes 

This  INDC  was  prepared  primarily  using  pre-existing  national  policy  documents, 
and  sector  policies  and  plans  to  ensure  accurate  reflection  of  national 
development priorities, with pre-existing stakeholder support.  

The  INDC  was  reviewed  by  Tonga's  Climate  Change  Technical  Group,  including 
representation of all key relevant agencies/Government Ministries, before formal 
Cabinet endorsement. 

Section 7: Climate Financing and Resourcing the INDC 

Prior to COP21, Tonga's commitment  over the past six years recorded over 30 percent of development 
assistance supported Tonga's climate change.  In addition to Government's ex-ante funding, Tonga does 
not have any dominant funding source for climate change but instead rely on the range of international 
and bilateral sources. 

Government  has  consolidated  MEIDECC  as  the  vehicle  to  step  up  its  ambition  and  mobilizing  climate 
financing  and  resourcing 
including  recurrent  (local),  national  (economy  wide)  or  transnational 
financing  The INDC framework provides the strategy towards low emission and scaled up investment in 
climate resilient development of Tonga. The INDC can serve as a key component Tonga's climate action 
plans,  financing  and  resource  mobilization  by  adopting  the  following  short  to  medium  initiatives 
recommended by the 2015 Climate Financing and Risk Governance Assessment; 

1.  Open to access climate financing through multiple channels; 

 

2.  Explore multi-pronged approach to accessing climate funds but not limited to the Green Climate 

Fund, Adaptation Fund, Climate Technology Centre and Network Global Environment Facility; 

3.  Open Processes for Climate Financing Options 
4.  Commit  appropriate  recurrent  budget  to  maintain  stable,  permanent,  well  trained  cadre  of 

climate financing staff to monitor and evaluate climate financing opportunities; 

12 

Section 8: Stakeholder Engagement 

In  preparation  for  COP21,  Tonga  has  agreed  to  table  its  INDC  under  the  TSDF  framework  where  key 
stakeholder engagements at local, regional and national level, to the climate change are facilitated by the 
TSDF institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluation on an annual basis. 

 In light of this IDNC, in partnership with economy wide counterparts, MEIDECC will host a broader set of 
stakeholder  consultations  post  COP  21  after  December  2015.  The  consultations  will  provide  an 
opportunity  to  discuss  Tonga's  position,  fill  gaps  and  build  a  common  understanding  and  approach 
towards  the  agreed  Paris  COP21  and  Tonga's  INDC.  These  stakeholder  engagements  will  provide  an 
opportunity to raise awareness, mobilize, inform and engage with key stakeholder groups and the general 
public around climate change issues, and climate change approach and response efforts at all levels. 

Section 9: Statement on "Fair and Ambitious" 

As noted, Tonga is classified as one of the most at-risk countries in the world in terms of its exposure to 
the unfolding effects of climate change. The current need for Tonga to invest large portions of its public 
service  capacity in the  ambitious quest to achieve our climate  resilience  objectives  is a consequence of 
the emissions of other large countries over many generations as they developed and became wealthy.  

Achieving  the  contributions  set  out  in  Tonga's  INDC  will  require  considerable  support  for  capacity  and 
technology investment. 

Section 10: General caveats statement 

The preparation of this INDC came at a time when Tonga is finalising  its Third National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventory  Report,  a  major  component  of  its  Third  National  Communication  on  Climate  Change  Project. 
This has meant that data on GHG emissions and emission projections are still  provisional. Data provided 
in this INDC is therefore subject to revision. The Third National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report, once 
completed, will provide a more comprehensive presentation of Tonga's circumstance, plans and needs.

Annex 2  
Specific strategies, policies, plans and actions, including timing and support needs  

The  table  below  provides  a  summary  of  current  priority  items  that  Tonga  wishes  to  highlight  as  needing  support  or  that  are  significant  initiatives  that  the 
government will take from their own budget resources. 

14 

These  relate  principally  to  mitigation  actions,  due  to  the  current  availability  of  information.  This  table  does  not  provide  details  on  general  resilience  building  and 
adaptation. For this to be properly done would require a detailed facilitated process. This has not been possible to do given time and budget constraints. As an important 
general point, the investments required to deliver a resilient future for Tonga in the face of climate change will be very significantly larger than just those addressing 
investments in the energy sector.

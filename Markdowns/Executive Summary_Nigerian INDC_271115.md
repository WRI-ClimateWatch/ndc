EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

National Context 

In  2014,  Nigeria  became  the  largest  economy  in  sub-Sahara  Africa.  Nigeria  is  a 
lower middle income developing country, the GDP per capita in current US$ is about 
$2,950.  The  economy  is  diversifying and has grown over 6% per year for the past 
decade. Yet, significant challenges remain. Food insecurity, lack of access to energy 
and high unemployment, amongst others, remain principal constraints on economic 
development  and  are  of  primary  concern  to  the  government.  Those  below  the 
poverty line of US$1.25 PPP still make up 30% of the population. The recent sharp 
decline in world oil prices has put pressure on the federal government budget, which 
continues to depend significantly on export revenues.  The Nigeria INDC, therefore, 
focuses on the delivery of direct development benefits and sustainable growth of the 
economy.  
In  addition  to  these  challenges,  the  country  is  considerably  impacted  by  climate 
change.  The  north  of  the  country,  for  example,  is  highly  vulnerable  to  drought.  A 
recent Pew Research Center global attitudes surveyi found that 65% of Nigerians are 
very  concerned  about  the  threat  climate  change  poses,  ahead  of  global  economic 
instability  (48%).  HE,  President  Muhammadu  Buhari  has  stated  in  his  inaugural 
speech  that  Nigeria  is  committed  to  tackling  climate  change.  Nigeria's  INDC 
demonstrates  its  determination  to  contribute  to  the  success  of  the  Paris  climate 
summit  in  December  2015  and  to  grow  its  economy  sustainably  while  reducing 
carbon pollution.  
The  INDC  promotes  sustainable  development  and  delivering  on  government 
priorities.  The  policies  and  measures  included  in  the  Nigeria  INDC  will  deliver 
immediate development benefits and do not compromise sustainable growth, on the 
contrary. Ambitious mitigation action is economically efficient and socially desirable 
for Nigeria, even when leaving aside its climate benefits. The policies and measures 
alleviate  poverty,  increase  social  welfare  and  inclusion,  as  well  as  improving 
individual  well-being,  which  includes  a  healthy  environment.  Furthermore,  by  not 
undertaking  these  measures  Nigeria  would  incur  significant  adaptation  costs  from 
exacerbated climate change.  
Nigeria has been actively engaged in international climate policy negotiations since it 
became  a  Party  to  the  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (FCCC)  in 
1994  ratifying  its  Kyoto  Protocol  in  2004.  Nigeria  submitted  its  First  National 
Communication  (FNC)  in  2003  and  a  Second  National  Communication  in  February 
2014. Nigeria is host to a number of Clean Development Mechanism projects, as well 
as  projects  financed  by  the  Adaptation  Fund.  In  September  2012,  the  Federal 
Executive  Council  approved  the  Nigeria  Climate  Change  Policy  Response  and 
Strategy. HE, President Muhammadu Buhari, The President of the Federal Republic 
of Nigeria on 26 November 2015, approved the Nigeria INDC.

Under a business-as-usual growth scenario, consistent with strong economic growth 
of  5%  per  year,  Nigeria's  emissions  are  expected  to  grow  to  around  900  million 
tonnes per year in 2030, which translates to around 3.4 tonnes per person. The key 
measures below could potentially reduce emissions by around 45 per cent compared 
to business as usual.  
Yet, Nigeria has a great potential for climate smart development, given support for 
implementation. Much of the reduction potential identified has zero net cost or indeed 
achieves a net economic benefit. That is, the measures would benefit Nigeria overall, 
even before taking into account the climate benefits.

Climate Change Policy Framework  
In order to reflect the increasing importance of climate change issues in Nigeria, the 
Federal  Executive  Council  adopted  in  2012  the  Nigeria  Climate  Change  Policy 
Response and Strategy. To ensure an effective national response to the significant 
and multi-facetted impacts of climate change, Nigeria has adopted a comprehensive 
strategy, as well as a number of specific policies. The strategic goal of the Nigeria 
Climate Change Policy Response and Strategy  is to foster low-carbon, high growth

economic development and build a climate resilient society through the attainment of 
the following objectives:  

Implement  mitigation  measures  that  will  promote  low  carbon  as  well  as 
sustainable and high economic growth; 

ü 
 
ü  Enhance national capacity to adapt to climate change; 
ü  Raise  climate  change  related  science,  technology  and  R&D  to  a  new  level 
that will enable the country to better participate in international scientific and 
 
 
technological cooperation on climate change;  
ü  Significantly 
 
ü  Strengthen  national  institutions  and  mechanisms  (policy,  legislative  and 
 
economic) to establish a suitable and functional framework for climate change 
 
governance.

increase  public  awareness  and 

involve  private  sector 

Climate Change Adaptation 
Nigeria  has  adopted  adaptation  policies  and  measures  described  in  more  detail  in 
section  3.2.2.  Nigeria's  response  to  climate  change  has  focused  on  increasing 
resilience  and  managing  the  unavoidable  impacts.  The  National  Adaptation 
Strategy and Plan of Action for Climate Change Nigeria (NASPA-CCN) describes 
our adaptation priorities, bringing together existing initiatives and priorities for future 
action.  The  2011  NASPA-CCN  Vision  is  a  Nigeria  in  which  climate  change 
adaptation  is  an  integrated  component  of  sustainable  development,  reducing  the 
vulnerability  and  enhancing  the  resilience  and  adaptive  capacity  of  all  economic 
sectors and of all people - particularly women, children, and resource-poor men - to 
the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change,  while  also  capturing  the  opportunities  that 
arise  as  a  result  of  climate  change.  Our  goal  is  to  take  action  to  adapt  to  climate 
change  by  reducing  vulnerability  to  climate  change  impacts  and  increasing  the 
resilience and sustainable wellbeing of all Nigerians; and to reduce or minimize risks 
by  improving  adaptive  capacity,  leveraging  new  opportunities,  and  facilitating 
collaboration inside Nigeria and with the global community. 
 
To  this  end,  a  set  of  thirteen  sector-specific  strategies,  policies,  programmes  and 
measures have been prepared, which are included in full in Annex 1 to this INDC. 
The  objectives  of  these  are  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  climate  change  through 
adaptation  measures  that  can  be  undertaken  by  the  Federal,  State  and  Local 
Governments,  civil  society,  private  sector,  communities  and  individuals,  including 
measures that will:  

1.  Improve awareness and preparedness for climate change impacts 
2.  Mobilize communities for climate change adaptation actions 
3.  Reduce  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  key  sectors  and  vulnerable 

communities 

4.  Integrate  climate  change  adaptation  into  national,  sectoral,  State  and  Local 
Government  planning  and  into  the  plans  of  universities,  research  and 
educational  organizations,  civil  society  organizations,  the  private  sector  and 
the media.

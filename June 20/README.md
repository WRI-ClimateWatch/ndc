Atom editor, with a Markdown rendering plugin:
https://atom.io/
https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview

These will work fine on windows, and the markdown plugin can be installed within the Atom program as a package add-on. All is free and open-source.

As for the automatic conversion from markdown to html, use Pandoc, again free/open source, and available for windows too:
